      <description>&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt you hate it when CTFs happen faster than you can write them up? This is probably the only PlaidCTF challenge I get to, unfortunately.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web is out, retro is in. Play your favorite word game from the comfort of your terminal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a terminal Wordle client!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/pppordle-1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/pppordle-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of a terminal Wordle client. The puzzle has been solved with the answer COZEY.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only solved the first half of this challenge. The two halves seem to be unrelated though. (Nobody solved the second half during the CTF.) The challenge was quite big code-wise, with more than a dozen files, so it‚Äôs hard to replicate the experience in a post like this, but here‚Äôs an attempt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;If I had a nickel for every &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/messy-desk&#34;&gt;CTF challenge I‚Äôve done&lt;/a&gt; that involves understanding the internal structure of a QR code, I would have two nickels. Which isn‚Äôt a lot, etc etc. That previous challenge probably helped me get first blood on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code is wonderfully short:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that kmh is gone, clam‚Äôs been going through pickle withdrawal. To help him cope, he wrote his own pickle pyjail. It‚Äôs nothing like kmh‚Äôs, but maybe it‚Äôs enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language jails are rapidly becoming one of my CTF areas of expertise. Not sure how I feel about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html&#34;&gt;pickle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a Python object serialization format. As the docs page loudly proclaims, it is not secure. Roughly the simplest possible code to pop a shell (adapted from &lt;a href=&#34;https://davidhamann.de/2020/04/05/exploiting-python-pickle/&#34;&gt;David Hamann&lt;/a&gt;, who constructs a more realistic RCE) looks like:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Interpreting Some Toy Neural Networks</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/interpret</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2022 23:26:13 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/interpret</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I participated in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eacambridge.org/agi-safety-fundamentals&#34;&gt;AGI Safety Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt; program recently. The program concludes with a flexible final project, with the default suggestion of ‚Äúa piece of writing, roughly the length and scope of a typical blog post‚Äù, so naturally, I deleted all but the last two words and here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I previously considered machine learning as a field of study, I came away with an impression that most effort and computation power was going into training bigger, more powerful models; whereas the inner workings of the models themselves, not to mention questions like why certain architectures or design choices work better than others, remained inscrutable and understudied. This impression always bothered me, and it definitely influenced me away from going into AI as a career. Of course, there are important, objective safety concerns around developing and designing models we don‚Äôt understand, many of which we discussed in the program; but my discomfort is mostly a completely unrelated nagging feeling I get whenever I‚Äôm relying on things I don‚Äôt understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the program and all the concurrent developments in AI (including &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.deepmind.com/blog/competitive-programming-with-alphacode&#34;&gt;AlphaCode&lt;/a&gt;, OpenAI‚Äôs &lt;a href=&#34;https://openai.com/blog/formal-math/&#34;&gt;math olympiad solver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://say-can.github.io/&#34;&gt;SayCan&lt;/a&gt;, and, of course, &lt;a href=&#34;https://openai.com/dall-e-2/&#34;&gt;DALL-E 2&lt;/a&gt;), I still had this impression about the field at a very high level, but I also became more familiar with the subfield of &lt;em&gt;interpretability&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äî designs and tools that allow us to understand and explain decisions by ML systems, rather than treating them as black-boxed mappings from inputs to outputs ‚Äî and confirmed that enough people study it to make it a thing. One quote from a post on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/X2i9dQQK3gETCyqh2/chris-olah-s-views-on-agi-safety&#34;&gt;views of Chris Olah&lt;/a&gt;, noted interpretability researcher, captured my feeling particularly eloquently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interpretability is very aligned with traditional scientific virtues‚Äîwhich can be quite motivating for many people‚Äîeven if it isn‚Äôt very aligned with the present paradigm of machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the whole post insightful, and it happens that the bits before that in the passage were also relevant to me. I don‚Äôt have access to lots of compute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by that post and by a desire to actually write some code (which I figured might help me understand the inner workings of modern ML systems in a different sense), and after abandoning a few other project ideas that were far too ambitious, I decided to go through some parts of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://course.fast.ai/&#34;&gt;fast.ai tutorial&lt;/a&gt; and riff on it to see how much progress I could make interpreting the models, and to write up the process in a blog post. I tried to capture my experience holistically, bugs and all, to serve as a data point for what it might feel like to start ML engineering (for the rare individuals with a background and inclinations just like mine&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; entertain more experienced practitioners or influence their future tutorial recommendations. A much lower-priority goal was trying to produce ‚Äúmy version of the tutorial‚Äù, which would draw more liberally from an undergraduate math education&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and dive more deeply into technical details.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend &lt;a href=&#34;https://galhacktictrendsetters.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;Galhacktic Trendsetters&lt;/a&gt; sort of spontaneously decided to do &lt;a href=&#34;https://ctf.dicega.ng/&#34;&gt;DiceCTF 2022&lt;/a&gt;, months or years after most of us had done another CTF. It was a lot of fun and we placed 6th!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/blazingfast</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend &lt;a href=&#34;https://galhacktictrendsetters.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;Galhacktic Trendsetters&lt;/a&gt; sort of spontaneously decided to do &lt;a href=&#34;https://ctf.dicega.ng/&#34;&gt;DiceCTF 2022&lt;/a&gt;, months or years after most of us had done another CTF. It was a lot of fun and we placed 6th!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a blazing fast MoCkInG CaSe converter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blazingfast.mc.ax&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre presented with a website that converts text to AlTeRnAtInG CaSe. The core converter is written in WASM, and also checks that its input doesn‚Äôt have any of the characters &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;&#34;&lt;/code&gt;. The JavaScript wrapper takes an input from the URL, converts it to uppercase, feeds it to the converter, and if the check passes, injects the output into an &lt;code&gt;innerHTML&lt;/code&gt;. The goal is to compose a URL that, when visited by an admin bot, leaks the flag from &lt;code&gt;localStorage&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The converter is compiled from this C code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb1&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode c&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode c&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-1&#34; title=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; length, ptr = &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-2&#34; title=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; buf[&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;];&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-3&#34; title=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-4&#34; title=&#34;4&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; init(&lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; size) {&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-5&#34; title=&#34;5&#34;&gt;    length = size;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-6&#34; title=&#34;6&#34;&gt;    ptr = &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-7&#34; title=&#34;7&#34;&gt;}&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-8&#34; title=&#34;8&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-9&#34; title=&#34;9&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; read() {&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-11&#34; title=&#34;11&#34;&gt;}&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-12&#34; title=&#34;12&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sixth year hunting with ‚úà‚úà‚úà Galactic Trendsetters ‚úà‚úà‚úà! As &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/2021-hunt&#34;&gt;last year‚Äôs writing team&lt;/a&gt; &lt;small&gt;(previously: &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/2020-hunt&#34;&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/2019-hunt&#34;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/2018-hunt&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/january&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/whoosh&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;, writing with Random in &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/hunt&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/small&gt; we had one final responsibility: running the traditional &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UNagEB8angIEJa7OqageeXj95UEuspAL0tDwekZJhzQ/edit#slide=id.p&#34;&gt;How to Hunt workshop&lt;/a&gt; shortly before this year‚Äôs hunt. I didn‚Äôt play a huge role in that, but I lurked and reminded myself some things about how new puzzlehunters think about puzzles, and I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-KmLvmcydguI_RBJJqHihbewZmssmdNtlWFJIJZVXLk/edit#gid=0&#34;&gt;Yet Another Puzzlehunt Spreadsheet Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; after casting around and being not entirely satisfied with the puzzlehunting spreadsheet tutorials I found. I think I actually understand ARRAYFORMULA now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, before we knew it, it was Hunt again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs really nice to get to solve Mystery Hunt again, and especially nice to do so on a team that was fairly actively trying not to win. GT generally tried not to add too many members this year, with some affiliated folks splitting off or hunting with other teams. During the hunt itself, we avoided backsolving puzzles that people were enjoying forward-solving, and encouraged people to be more confident before guessing answers. We ended up with a &amp;gt;50% guess accuracy&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, much higher than some of our past participations, and at least for the puzzles I participated in that took more than a few incorrect answers, I think they were all reasonable guesses or honest mistakes (&lt;span class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;VALLICELLIANA&lt;/span&gt; is difficult to spell) rather than attempts at short-circuiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I did the hunt as part of a roughly 10-person west coast contingent who met up in real life (and who all tested negative for COVID shortly before or after arrival). I think I got roughly three times as much sleep as I did during the 2020 hunt, when we won, and I felt freer to hop onto puzzles that were greatly oversaturated with solvers, such as A Number of Games and How to Install a Handle, or to try less hard looking for extraction steps after doing the fun meat of a puzzle. I think a lot of team members took a similar approach; based on our solve log, we solved no metas between 3am and noon (ET) on either day, and generally had much starker dead zones of activity in the mornings than in past years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs another year, huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2021 is the first year during which I held a full-time job continuously. My disposable income and discretionary spending have both increased the most sharply since, well, ever. It‚Äôs weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still in a pandemic. Greek letters continue to be associated with uncool things. I got vaccinated and started taking measured (but still small) risks. Funny story: my first vaccination was a complete surprise, as my roommate knocked on my door mid-day to inform me that somebody he knew had extra vaccines to give out ‚Äî except that the night before I had a dream about being vaccinated, which was weird enough that I wrote that dream down, something I do only once every few months. I also got boosted just a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else happened to me in 2021?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Just Enough Elliptic Curves to Be Dangerous</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/elliptic-curves</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 18:24:18 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/elliptic-curves</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A famous Trail of Bits post says to &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/08/fuck-rsa/&#34;&gt;stop using RSA&lt;/a&gt;: it‚Äôs simple enough to make people think they can implement it correctly, but full of invisible traps. In contrast, although elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) implementations could also fall into subtle traps, they usually don‚Äôt. The post conjectures that this is because ECC intimidates people into using cryptographically sound libraries instead of implementing their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do want to understand ECC just enough to produce your own trap-ridden implementation, though, this post aims to get you there. (Assuming some mathematical background chosen in a not particularly principled way, approximately what I had before writing this post.) Hence the title. Because I have a cryptographic conscience, I will still point out the traps I know of; but there are probably traps I don‚Äôt know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post contains a lot of handwaving and straight-up giving up on proofs. You don‚Äôt need to know the proofs to be dangerous. The ethos is sort of like &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.evanchen.cc/napkin.html&#34;&gt;Napkin&lt;/a&gt;, but way shoddier and with zero pretense of pedagogical soundness. Still, here are some concrete questions that I learned the answer to while writing this post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does the group law hold, sort of intuitively?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do people have to modify Curve25519 before using it to compute digital signatures?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a ‚Äúquadratic twist‚Äù and why should I care about it to pick a secure elliptic curve?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is it possible that an isogeny can be described surjective but not injective while mapping a finite elliptic curve to another elliptic curve of the same cardinality?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many claws does an alligator have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elliptic curves have a lot of complicated algebra. If you ever studied algebra in high school and did exercises where you had to simplify or factor or graph some really complicated algebraic expression, and you learned that algebra is also the name of a field in higher mathematics, you might have assumed that working algebraists just dealt with even more complicated expressions. If you then studied algebra in college, you‚Äôd probably have realized that that‚Äôs not really what algebra is about at all; the difficulty comes from &lt;em&gt;new abstractions&lt;/em&gt;, like a bunch of the terms above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well‚Ä¶ the study of elliptic curves involves a bunch of complicated expressions like what your high school self might have imagined. Sometimes, notes will just explode into a trainwreck of terms like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align*}\psi_1 &amp;amp;= 1 \\ \psi_2 &amp;amp;= 2y \\ \psi_3 &amp;amp;= 3x^4 + 6Ax^2 + 12Bx - A^2 \\ \psi_4 &amp;amp;= 4y(x^6 + 5Ax^4 + 20Bx^3 - 5A^2x^2 - 4ABx - A^3 - 8B^2).\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThis is REAL Math, done by REAL Mathematicians,‚Äù one is tempted to quip. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://hyperelliptic.org/EFD/&#34;&gt;Explicit-Formulas Database&lt;/a&gt; is a fun place to take a gander through. I will copy formulas into this post from time to time when there‚Äôs something about them I want to call attention to, but in general we won‚Äôt do any complicated algebraic manipulations in this post. Just be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I‚Äôm focusing on conceptual understanding (and am lazy), this post contains almost no code, and definitely no code that‚Äôs runnable in any real programming language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>One Weird Anki Trick</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/anki-trick</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 01:35:57 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/anki-trick</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine you had a button you could press whenever you saw or heard something you wanted to remember. By holding that button down for about a minute, you‚Äôll be able to remember that thing &lt;em&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt;. There are no undesirable side effects. Sounds like a pretty good deal, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs only one catch: you have to regularly find new things to press the button on. If you stop for more than a few days, the effects wear off. If you ask me, it still seems almost too good to be true! But it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs the magic of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition&#34;&gt;spaced repetition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had known about this magic for a long time and read blog posts from all directions telling me to use it, typically but not necessarily through &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.ankiweb.net/&#34;&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt;. Examples include Nicky Case‚Äôs &lt;a href=&#34;https://ncase.me/remember/&#34;&gt;interactive guide&lt;/a&gt; and Alexey Guzey‚Äôs &lt;a href=&#34;https://guzey.com/things/software/anki/&#34;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt;; and because this has been so well-covered, I won‚Äôt go into how or why spaced repetition works or how one would use Anki in this post. Still, for a long time, I found the one ‚Äúcatch‚Äù to be of the -22 variety: I didn‚Äôt use Anki regularly because I didn‚Äôt have any flash cards of things I wanted to remember; but I didn‚Äôt make any flash cards of things I wanted to remember because, given that I didn‚Äôt use Anki regularly, making those flash cards wouldn‚Äôt actually help me remember those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the One Weird Anki Trick that got me to finally turn spaced repetition into a habit: I created an Anki deck with a bunch of amusing but utterly useless cards,&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in order to make studying the Anki deck an entertaining activity I actually wanted to do. (Getting the mobile app and syncing my deck online also helped a lot.) Only after I started to habitually check my Anki deck did I start adding cards for the things I actually wanted to learn. I keep everything in one deck,&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; so that my fun cards are spread out among my ‚Äúwork‚Äù cards, and when I find myself losing motivation, I add more useless entertainment cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the whole post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Color Should My Discord Roles/Reactions Be?</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/discord-color</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 20:17:51 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/discord-color</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I subscribed to Discord Nitro a month ago, but only recently did I start thinking about the full range of powers the subscription granted me. I could create my own reactions, dump them in my personal server, and use them to react anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I finally started trying to create some reactions, I hit an interesting snag: Discord can be used in dark and light mode,&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a reaction will have the same color on both modes. If I wanted my reaction to be as clearly readable in both modes as possible, what color should I make it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I could, of course, just outline my reaction with a contrasting color, but let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs cheating. With the limited space in a reaction, outlining isn‚Äôt that great of a solution anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, one can‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; just compute the ‚Äúcontrast of two colors‚Äù given only their RGB components; there‚Äôs no universally agreed-on definition of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(vision)&#34;&gt;contrast in vision&lt;/a&gt;, and even if there were one, the contrast of two given colors would depend on the color space and possibly the viewer‚Äôs biology. But, to get a concrete answer to this question, we can use the standard sRGB model and the W3C‚Äôs definitions of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#dfn-contrast-ratio&#34;&gt;contrast ratio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#dfn-relative-luminance&#34;&gt;relative luminance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As of time of writing on my computer,&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Discord reactions have background &lt;span style=&#34;padding:0.15em 0.4em;background-color:#2f3136;color:white&#34;&gt;#2f3136&lt;/span&gt; on dark mode and &lt;span style=&#34;padding:0.15em 0.4em;background-color:#f2f3f5&#34;&gt;#f2f3f5&lt;/span&gt; on light mode. Reactions you‚Äôve reacted with have background &lt;span style=&#34;padding:0.15em 0.4em;background-color:#3b405a;color:white&#34;&gt;#3b405a&lt;/span&gt; on dark mode and &lt;span style=&#34;padding:0.15em 0.4em;background-color:#e7e9fd&#34;&gt;#e7e9fd&lt;/span&gt; on light mode. Because the dark mode background gets lighter and the light mode background gets darker, we‚Äôll use the latter colors so we‚Äôre optimizing the worst-case contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are smarter approaches, but the 256&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 16,777,216 possible 8-bit colors are perfectly feasible to brute force, so I wrote a short Python script to check all of them, which is at the bottom of this post. Under the parameters I‚Äôve outlined, the optimal color for a Discord reaction is &lt;span style=&#34;padding:0.15em 0.4em;background-color:#ff4103&#34;&gt;rgb(255, 65, 3) or #ff4103.&lt;/span&gt; A demo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;background-color:#3b405a;color:#ff4103&#34;&gt;
#ff4103 &lt;strong&gt;#ff4103&lt;/strong&gt; ‚óè&lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;&lt;abbr title=&#34;Contrast Ratio&#34;&gt;CR&lt;/abbr&gt;: 2.90738237&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;background-color:#e7e9fd;color:#ff4103&#34;&gt;
#ff4103 &lt;strong&gt;#ff4103&lt;/strong&gt; ‚óè &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;&lt;abbr title=&#34;Contrast Ratio&#34;&gt;CR&lt;/abbr&gt;: 2.90738217&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was simple enough, but this color‚Äôs worst-case contrast ratio is less than 0.0000002 better than the runner-up. Surely even very mild aesthetic considerations will outweigh that. (It‚Äôs highly doubtful that the formulae I used were intended to have this degree of precision in the first place.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After playing with a few ways to get a spread of options, I settled on categorizing colors into six buckets of saturation and twelve buckets of hue in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#Formal_derivation&#34;&gt;simple HSV model&lt;/a&gt;, and then finding the optimal color within each bucket. Here is a table of my results:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SQL Selects the Hard FP Way</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/sql-select</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Apr 2021 19:41:49 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/sql-select</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is motivated by reasons very similar to the ones that motivated my &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/react-redux&#34;&gt;React and Redux ‚Äútutorial‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;. Again, it should be more accurately but less informatively titled ‚ÄúHow I wish SQL SELECTs were explained to me‚Äù. Again, it does not imply that this method of explanation is suitable for anybody else. One difference is that this time, I mostly only wanted to learn about SQL SELECTs to the extent it would help me perform and optimize queries in Django‚Äôs ORM, but to prevent this post from languishing forever in my drafts folder, that material has been sectioned off into a possible future post, because I figured out what I wanted, ran out of steam, and am now trying to learn TLA‚Å∫. Just me things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SQL standard is confusing and almost never completely implemented; there are huge inconsistencies between SQL implementations. I will focus on SQLite because it‚Äôs popular and easy to play with, but generally try to stay away from unpopular or nonstandard features. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/lang_select.html&#34;&gt;SQLite‚Äôs SELECT documentation&lt;/a&gt; is good reading for &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; particular SQL implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A SQL database is a place where you store and query a bunch of data that‚Äôs organized into tables. A table is a homogeneous list of rows. A row is a heterogeneous tuple of values of various simple data types. The data types supported depend on the SQL implementation; typical examples are integers and strings of various sizes, floating point numbers, and dates/datetimes. All of these types can be nullable; NULL is a SQL value that can appear just about anywhere. (Like many of the other SQL features, NULL is handled somewhat inconsistently across SQL implementations, but as a first-order approximation it‚Äôs closer to a floating-point NaN than, say, Java‚Äôs ‚Äúnull‚Äù. We‚Äôll talk more about it later.) However, note that you can‚Äôt have a variable-size list of other things in a row. And just to make sure it‚Äôs clear, all the rows in a given table must have the same data types in the same order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ‚Äúcolumn‚Äù is just what you‚Äôd intuitively expect it to be: it‚Äôs the homogeneous list of all values in a particular position in each row of a table, which all have the same data type. One thing I haven‚Äôt mentioned yet is that table columns all have names. This is true both for tables stored in the database and for the ephemeral tables that are the output of queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I‚Äôll also be referring to more complex types like lists and tuples often seen in conventional programming languages, I‚Äôll call these simple data types ‚Äúscalar types‚Äù and values of those types ‚Äúscalars‚Äù. This is not SQL terminology; documentation usually just calls these ‚Äúdata types‚Äù. Here‚Äôs &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html&#34;&gt;SQLite‚Äôs page on data types&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To play along, install SQLite and run it. You should get dropped into a connection to an ephemeral in-memory database, which is plenty enough for our purposes. Make a table and mutter some magic incantations to make the output a little prettier for us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb1&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode sql&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode sql&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-1&#34; title=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; a (&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-2&#34; title=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;INSERT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;INTO&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;VALUES&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;), (&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;), (&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;), (&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Blogging Advice For People Exactly Like Me</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/blogging-advice</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2021 00:24:46 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/blogging-advice</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that it‚Äôs harder to become an MIT admissions blogger as an MIT student than it is to get into MIT as an applicant? It was true my year, in which 18,306 students applied and 1,467 were admitted (8.0%),&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; whereas 69 students applied for 5 blogging spots (7.2%).&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Anecdotally it might also be true for future years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was among the 92.8% who got rejected in the latter process. Although I obviously would have preferred things go the other way, I can‚Äôt say I was surprised, firstly because, objectively, the odds were against me (as they were for every other individual applicant); secondly because, to the extent I can make educated guesses about the criteria the folks at MIT Admissions would have chosen bloggers by, I would have been close to the worst possible candidate;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; thirdly because my application probably wasn‚Äôt very good.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt dwell on it; I just thought to myself some vague consoling thoughts and moved on. No matter what I missed out on, at least I retained complete freedom: to choose what to write about, when to post it, and how to format and typeset it, down to the very last &lt;code style=&#34;box-shadow: 1px -1px 3px rgba(170,0,0,0.5)&#34;&gt;box-shadow&lt;/code&gt;. Right? But, although I mostly successfully avoided thinking about it, there really was a lot to like about being an admissions blogger! I liked writing ‚Äî or perhaps, I liked &lt;em&gt;being a person who has written a lot&lt;/em&gt; more, and having a commitment to blog regularly would be a way to force myself to become that person. I liked the idea of getting to share things with thousands of readers, or less euphemistically I liked the thought of being, if ever so slightly, famous.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I liked the idea of having a sketched portrait and being part of official events with ‚ÄúBlogger‚Äù in the title and all that jazz. Collectively these things just felt &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, though, that there were things I could do to try to get those things for myself, and I didn‚Äôt do them. I know how to force myself to blog regularly, which is just by announcing publicly to nobody in particular that I‚Äôll blog regularly (it‚Äôs worked effectively at least twice). I know many places I could promote my blog and try to get more readers. I can buy a sketched portrait.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It‚Äôs not that hard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Well, we did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://perpendicular.institute/&#34;&gt;‚úà‚úà‚úà Galactic Trendsetters ‚úà‚úà‚úà ran an MIT Mystery Hunt.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, it slipped my mind until trying to write the 2020 year-end post that I‚Äôd probably want to write a post on all this. In fact, there was one major project that I started in 2019, but that I didn‚Äôt think of mentioning in my 2019 year-end post because it wasn‚Äôt ready to be announced at that time, and that I almost forgot that I had never mentioned. But this post is a pretty good place to announce it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning Mystery Hunt is a massive year-long endeavor. I didn‚Äôt have any leadership or otherwise high-responsibility roles, which made sense because I was busy writing a masters thesis for the first four months of Mystery Hunt planning. Because of that, and because I know many many other people on our team have written and will be writing blog posts (&lt;a href=&#34;https://fortenf.org/e/2021/01/28/mystery-hunt-2021-part-1.html&#34;&gt;Rahul‚Äôs post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npinsker.me/puzzles/retrospective&#34;&gt;Nathan‚Äôs post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/two-hundred-puzzles-2/&#34;&gt;CJ‚Äôs post&lt;/a&gt;, maybe more to come?) I will focus on the things I did specifically. (So there is minimal discussion of the theme, overall organization, or big decisions like our COVID-19 response; I think the linked posts cover these well already.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;puzzle-writing-software&#34;&gt;Puzzle-Writing Software&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One part I did largely have ‚Äúownership‚Äù of, and that I sank a lot of time into, was maintaining our software for writing puzzles ‚Äî the website where authors submitted puzzle ideas and drafts, testsolvers tested puzzles, and editors tracked and discussed the statuses of all the puzzles. This role was largely a continuation of me owning the same component for Galactic Puzzle Hunt since 2018, which itself grew out of the comparative advantage of having worked on it a little when &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/hunt&#34;&gt;writing with Random Fish for the 2015 MIT Mystery Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. There is some life lesson about specialization or pigeonholing to be learned here. But, to start at the beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mysteryhunt/puzzle-editing/&#34;&gt;Puzzletron&lt;/a&gt; is a piece of PHP software used for organizing puzzle writing for puzzlehunts. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mysteryhunt/puzzle-editing/commit/f67a67d63aa78708c4ca94132f1dce9dbbc116ac&#34;&gt;first commit on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; says it was imported from Metaphysical Plant in 2011; it‚Äôs likely older. There are active commits each year until January 2018, and AMA responses from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/mysteryhunt/comments/am5s1d/were_setec_astronomy_and_we_just_ran_a_mystery/efjrzs4/&#34;&gt;Setec (2019)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/mysteryhunt/comments/eucu3x/ama_we_are_left_out_design_team_for_the_2020/ffnzq80/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3&#34;&gt;Left Out (2020)&lt;/a&gt; mentioning it, so I believe most if not all Mystery Hunt writing teams used and improved Puzzletron and passed it down over those years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>‚Ä¶And I Feel Fine</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/and-i-feel-fine</link>

      <description>&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Is73BbYhFz4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a strange and darkly funny story ‚Äî Tim Minchin wrote the album this is from, &lt;a href=&#34;https://tim-minchin.lnk.to/ApartTogetherAlbumWE&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Apart Together&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, well before the pandemic hit and social distancing became the norm, and I assume I am not alone in finding that the song resonates unusually strongly as a result.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; By Jove, it resonates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody needs me to say that it‚Äôs been a rough year. People have been complaining that each of the last few years were terrible, and looking forward to the next one, and being disappointed ‚Äî as if years were coherent bundles of quality, and there was any reason to expect discontinuities in how things are going to occur around January 1st ‚Äî and as if there were additionally any reason to expect such discontinuities, if they did exist, to be positive ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, do you remember when we thought 2015‚Äì2018 were bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;AH YES, THE BAD YEAR IS NEARLY OVER&amp;quot; I SAID FOOLISHLY FOR THE FOURTH YEAR IN A ROW, UNAWARE OF WHAT FRESH HORRORS 2019 WOULD BRING&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; NOT A WOLF (@SICKOFWOLVES) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SICKOFWOLVES/status/1072260861031460865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;December 10, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet‚Ä¶ I feel like overall, 2020 went quite a bit better than expectations for me. Which maybe means it‚Äôs astronomically better than the average person‚Äôs 2020. I had a long draft for this post that slowly accumulated words over the year as usual, but a lot of the ramblings I‚Äôd usually include now seem unusually vapid, and a lot of the deeper trends and experiences I might normally reflect on are things I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve really gone through or thought about for long enough to achieve closure on. This is partly due to the pandemic scrambling a lot of plans and partly because last January, nearly a full year ago, &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/2020-hunt&#34;&gt;‚úà‚úà‚úà Galactic Trendsetters ‚úà‚úà‚úà won Mystery Hunt&lt;/a&gt; and so we‚Äôre writing the 2021 hunt. The ramifications are still being felt and will accelerate until it actually happens two weeks from now, and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôll say about it here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Advent of Code: How to Leaderboard</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/advent-leaderboard</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2020 19:13:19 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/advent-leaderboard</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/&#34;&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; (briefly, ‚ÄúAoC‚Äù) is a series of 25 festive programming puzzles&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; released daily December 1‚Äì25. Each puzzle has two parts, which use the same text input and are related; to solve a part, you submit the right output corresponding to the input on the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre reading this, I suspect there‚Äôs a good chance you knew that already, but in case you‚Äôre new to Advent of Code, let me try to briefly explain why I like Advent of Code, from the perspective of somebody who‚Äôs spent a lot of their life so far doing programming competitions.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The event has a fantastic community surrounding it. I‚Äôm the most familiar with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/&#34;&gt;the subreddit&lt;/a&gt;, which is full of helpful people, interesting discussions, non-programming community games, and the occasional &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e6iw6l/day_5_browserbased_interactive_intcode_processor/&#34;&gt;wonderfully&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e7ylwd/i_solved_day_8_entirely_in_minecraft/&#34;&gt;spectacularly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/eb79s0/2019_day_10_blowing_up_asteroids_in_unity/&#34;&gt;overengineered&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/ea8mif/2019_day_13_excel_did_you_think_i_would_give_up/&#34;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt; to a puzzle; but I know there are also many smaller chatrooms and subcommunities focused on, say, specific timezones or programming languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another aspect is the unique two-part format of each puzzle. Even though they use the same input, you don‚Äôt get to see the second part until after you‚Äôve solved the first one, a feature that Eric Wastl (AoC‚Äôs creator) has taken full advantage of in designing puzzles. The second part is often a surprising twist on the first part, which keeps you on your toes and challenges you to keep your code moderately general or refactorable in a way that I think almost no other programming challenges do. This sometimes even happens between days in a calendar, when a puzzle turns out to be about some model of computation you implemented two or five or ten days ago ‚Äî hope you kept your code and remember how it works!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, AoC also has some non-rigorous puzzles that force you to use your intuition and ‚Äúhuman intelligence‚Äù, either by interpreting the problem statement heuristically or writing code to let you explore the input. There are quite a few puzzles where it‚Äôs infeasible to write code that handles every step of obtaining the output from the input. The result is that Advent of Code can feature quite a few challenges that I‚Äôve found particularly compelling because I think they simply could not be posed on any other contest platform.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the things that make AoC stand out to me, but it also does a lot of other things well ‚Äî the challenges are fun, approachable, and varied even aside from their interrelations; there is a long, dramatic story tying everything together (although it‚Äôs an &lt;a href=&#34;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot&#34;&gt;Excuse Plot&lt;/a&gt; if there ever was such a thing); and, although this is obviously subjective, I find the website‚Äôs minimalist-adjacent, terminal-esque aesthetic really charming (there is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of detail in &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2019&#34;&gt;2019‚Äôs calendar&lt;/a&gt;‚Ä¶ after you solve everything). I‚Äôve only done the last two years of Advent of Code, but it really seems like a one-of-a-kind event to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, one particular feature Advent of Code has is a leaderboard, which you can get on by being one of the first 100 people worldwide to solve each puzzle. The competition is fierce ‚Äî every year, thousands of people compete to get on the leaderboard. Near the start of AoC 2019, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/mcpower/87427528b9ba5cac6f0c679370789661&#34;&gt;mcpower&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e2wjhf/tips_for_getting_on_the_advent_of_code_leaderboard/&#34;&gt;reddit discussion&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://kevinyap.ca/2019/12/going-fast-in-advent-of-code/&#34;&gt;Kevin Yap&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e82f7a/going_fast_in_advent_of_code/&#34;&gt;reddit discussion&lt;/a&gt;) wrote some articles about how to do this, both of which are worth reading. I also thought about writing such an article and started a draft, but I didn‚Äôt get it anywhere close to publishable before AoC had concluded, at which point I assumed few people would be interested. But here it is now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>C&#43;&#43; Rvalue References: The Unnecessarily Detailed Guide</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/rvalue-references</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 00:25:50 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/rvalue-references</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By a strange quirk of fate, I have started writing C++ for a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning C++ was about as complicated as I think I expected it to be. By line count, I‚Äôve written a lot of C++ for programming competitions, but I knew that I had only ever used a small cross-section of the language: basic control flow and variables, STL containers and algorithms, structs on which you mechanically define &lt;code&gt;bool operator&amp;lt;(const T&amp;amp; other) const&lt;/code&gt; so STL algorithms can order them, and the very occasional macro or templated helper function. There were many features I wasn‚Äôt even aware existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of learning C++ professionally, one rabbit hole I fell into quickly was C++11‚Äôs defining feature, the &lt;em&gt;rvalue reference&lt;/em&gt;, and how it can be used to implement &lt;em&gt;move semantics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;perfect forwarding&lt;/em&gt;. By poring over a copy of the widely recommended book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Modern-Specific-Ways-Improve/dp/1491903996&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Effective Modern C++&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Scott Meyers, and a few dozen StackOverflow answers and blog posts, I roughly understood it after a few days, but still had a sort of blind-men-feeling-the-elephant feeling. I was confused about what lay under some of the abstractions I had been using, unsure of the full shape of the pitfalls that some of the guides had pointed out to me, and generally uncomfortable that there were still many small variations of the code I had seen that I couldn‚Äôt predict the behavior of. It took many more days to work myself out of there, and I wished I had had a guide that explained rvalue references and their applications to a bit more depth than what might be necessary for day-to-day use. So here‚Äôs my attempt to explain rvalue references in my own fundamental I-want-to-know-how-things-work-no-&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If this vision doesn‚Äôt resonate with you, there are many other posts explaining rvalue references out there that you might prefer. Feel free to just skim the executive summary and/or check out some of the linked articles in the Background section.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;executive-summary&#34;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got‚Ä¶ pretty carried away when writing this post, and a lot of it is just for my own understanding, which may or may not be useful to readers. Here‚Äôs a much more concise rundown (assuming you know basic C++ already):&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Signed Modulo</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/modulo</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2020 18:00:58 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/modulo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing many mathematically-inclined programmers run into when implementing mathematical algorithms, particularly number-theoretic ones, is that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation&#34;&gt;modulo operation&lt;/a&gt; doesn‚Äôt behave how they expect or prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many languages, this operator is denoted &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;. Concretely, one might prefer that, if the second argument is positive, then the modulo operation would always give a nonnegative result. Under this behavior, the expression &lt;code&gt;(-5) % 3&lt;/code&gt; would evaluate to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;-2&lt;/code&gt;. This is a lot more useful for number theory because then for positive integers &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;% n&lt;/code&gt; operation actually maps integers to exactly the &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; canonical representatives for the residue classes. As a result, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(a \equiv b \mod n\)&lt;/span&gt; if and only if &lt;code&gt;a % n == b % n&lt;/code&gt;. You can also do things like index into a length-&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; array with &lt;code&gt;a % n&lt;/code&gt; and know that the index will be in-bounds. Finally, there are also optimization opportunities: modding by a power of 2 becomes equivalent to a simple bitwise AND, which is really fast on modern computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few programming languages, notably Python, do implement &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; this way. However, the majority of languages today, including pretty much everything remotely descended from C, do not; instead, &lt;code&gt;(-5) % 3&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;-2&lt;/code&gt;. This post attempts to track down why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to note is that there is a more important number-theoretic identity we‚Äôd like to have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\texttt{a} = (\texttt{a / b}) \cdot \texttt{b} + (\texttt{a \% b}). \tag{1}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In words, the integer division and modulo operators should give a breakdown of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; into a sum of some copies of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; plus a remainder. Note that this equation also implies that specifying the rounding behavior of division is equivalent to specifying the sign behavior of the modulo operation, which will come up repeatedly later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs also very uncontroversial that that remainder should have no copies of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, positive or negative, left over, which gives the constraint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[|\texttt{a \% b}| &amp;lt; |\texttt{b}|. \tag{2}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every programming language I can think of satisfies these two constraints.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; So far so good. However, these two constraints don‚Äôt uniquely determine the values of &lt;code&gt;a % b&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; isn‚Äôt divisible by &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;; there are two possible values for &lt;code&gt;a % b&lt;/code&gt;, one positive and one negative. Concretely, we could express &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(-5\)&lt;/span&gt; as either &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((-1) \cdot 3 + (-2)\)&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((-2) \cdot 3 + 1\)&lt;/span&gt;, so &lt;code&gt;(-5) % 3&lt;/code&gt; could be &lt;code&gt;-2&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs still mostly uncontroversial that, if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are both positive, then &lt;code&gt;a % b&lt;/code&gt; should be nonnegative as well; we could call this constraint (3).&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is negative and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is positive, programming languages start to diverge in their behavior. Why?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2020 MIT Mystery Hunt</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/2020-hunt</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2020 23:24:47 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/2020-hunt</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fifth year with ‚úà‚úà‚úà Galactic Trendsetters ‚úà‚úà‚úà (previously: &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/2019-hunt&#34;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/2018-hunt&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/january&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/whoosh&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;; writing with Random in &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/hunt&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But apparently I‚Äôm still really busy, so I‚Äôll probably just focus on a few highlights of things I personally experienced and get this post out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme in a few sentences: As suggested by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/mysteryhunt/comments/eo475t/you_are_cordially_invited/&#34;&gt;the invitation&lt;/a&gt; sent out to teams, there was a wedding. It turned out to actually be a real wedding between two prolific puzzle writers on Left Out, the organizing team. To the surprise of everybody who expected either one, three, or maybe five subversions of this announcement, the wedding actually succeeded (a COIN that would prevent all love in the universe was briefly reported missing, but then immediately found by the bride). Instead, we joined the newlyweds on a trip to an amusement park called Penny Park, which we learned was struggling and closing this weekend. It was up to help its regain its popularity and stay open by solving puzzles. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/mysteryhunt/&#34;&gt;Mystery Hunt subreddit&lt;/a&gt; has lots of other cool links and discussions, including this &lt;a href=&#34;https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/1267425/&#34;&gt;animated bar chart&lt;/a&gt;, so I won‚Äôt spend more time here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm pretty sure the best story I personally experienced was how we solved the metameta, the biggest puzzle that stood between us and winning hunt, and the moment at which we went, holy smokes we might have won Mystery Hunt! We got all the pennies required for the final metameta at Sunday 5:48:09am, and it took us until 12:47:30pm, just under &lt;em&gt;seven hours later&lt;/em&gt;, to solve it‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a weird song choice ‚Äî I have not even watched the movie. But there is a story, and there is a thematic correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is that I was interning remotely at a coworking space over the summer. One night, I attended a karaoke event hosted there, the kind where adult human beings socialize and where I didn‚Äôt know anybody else, and I sang this song. Afterwards, another attendee told me that her kid (yeah, you know, people in my reference class have children) loved Moana and was really excited about my performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thematic correspondence is less obvious and harder for me to describe. I‚Äôm going much less further this year than I could be, and am less sure about next year than I expected to be at this point for reasons I‚Äôm not ready to share yet (this seems to be happening more and more on this blog, but there‚Äôs not much I can do about it ‚Äî so it goes). But it really is the case that there are some things I can‚Äôt deny about myself, some attractor states that my values and way of thinking keep dragging me towards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frivolous examples: I went through another online Dominion phase and at least two Protobowl phases, the highlight of which is learning a good deal about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Durkheim&#34;&gt;√âmile Durkheim&lt;/a&gt; and then buzzing on him the next day. I did Advent of Code again, with the same golfing setup as last year, a foray into making an auxiliary &lt;a href=&#34;https://betaveros.github.io/extra-aoc-stats/&#34;&gt;over-the-top leaderboard&lt;/a&gt; in Svelte, and (surprisingly to myself) getting first. I have a shiny Charizard with Blast Burn now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rocket Equation</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/advent-rocket</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs December, so it‚Äôs time for a lot of things, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/&#34;&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt;. I will not be able to be as competitive as I was last year, and already lost a lot of points to a really silly mistake on day 1, but I‚Äôll be playing when I can and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/betaveros/advent-of-code-golf-2019&#34;&gt;golfing&lt;/a&gt; the problems when I have time (so far: 7 + 14 bytes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one might expect, &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/a&gt; is not too complex, but the second part can be analyzed to some mathematical depth and was discussed a bit on Reddit; plus, it occurred to me recently that I set up KaTeX on my blog but never used it, so I was looking for an excuse to write some equations anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem statement for part 2, in brief: We are tasked with calculating the total mass of fuel required to launch a rocket module of a given mass. For something of mass &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt;, one can compute the directly required mass of fuel by dividing &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt; by 3, rounding down, and subtracting 2; if the result is negative, it is taken to be 0 instead. However, the directly required fuel also requires fuel itself, calculated from its own mass by the same procedure, and that required fuel requires fuel based on its own mass, and so on until you reach fuel with 0 requirement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>baby_boi (A Textbook CTF ROP Tutorial)</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/baby-boi</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to pwn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nc pwn.chal.csaw.io 1005&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahhh, CSAW CTF. Amidst all the other CTFs where we‚Äôre competing with security professionals who probably have decades of experience and who follow security developments for a living or whatever, there remains a competition where scrubs like me can apply our extremely basic CTF skills and still feel kinda smart by earning points. Now that I‚Äôve graduated and am no longer eligible, our team was pretty small and I didn‚Äôt dedicate the full weekend to the CTF, but it means I got to do the really easy challenges in the categories that I was the worst at, by which I mean pwn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;baby_boi&lt;/code&gt; is pretty much the simplest possible modern ROP (the modern security protections NX and ASLR are not artificially disabled, but you get everything you need to work around them). We even get source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb1&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode c&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode c&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-1&#34; title=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pp&#34;&gt;#include &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;im&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-2&#34; title=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pp&#34;&gt;#include &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;im&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-3&#34; title=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-4&#34; title=&#34;4&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; main(&lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; argc, &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; **argv[]) {&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-5&#34; title=&#34;5&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; buf[&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;];&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-6&#34; title=&#34;6&#34;&gt;  printf(&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sc&#34;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-7&#34; title=&#34;7&#34;&gt;  printf(&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Here I am: %p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sc&#34;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, printf);&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-8&#34; title=&#34;8&#34;&gt;  gets(buf);&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-9&#34; title=&#34;9&#34;&gt;}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there‚Äôs nothing novel here for experienced pwners, but I feel like there is a shortage of tutorials that walk you through how to solve a textbook ROP the way you‚Äôd want to solve it in a CTF, so here is a writeup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introduction to Puzzlehunts</title>

&lt;p&gt;not part of the ongoing series, but you can almost pretend it is. This sentence and the one before it are not a puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a word search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine you aren‚Äôt told what words to look for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine you aren‚Äôt told it‚Äôs a word search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine it isn‚Äôt a word search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;
‚Äî &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gmpuzzles.com/blog/2013/04/ask-dr-sudoku-13-puzzle-hunting/&#34;&gt;Mike Develin, via Thomas Snyder&lt;/a&gt; (aka Dr.¬†Sudoku)
&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post aims to be a fairly comprehensive introduction to puzzlehunts and their puzzles, a single post where I can just point people. I erred towards comprehensiveness in this post because I am not aware of any similar resources, especially for puzzlers interested in trying harder puzzlehunts who might not know any more experienced puzzlers to solve with. It‚Äôs possible to start solving some puzzles after reading much shorter guides, e.g.¬†Puzzled Pint‚Äôs &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.puzzledpint.com/files/3513/8254/7894/2013_10_22_Puzzling_Basics_Infographic.pdf&#34;&gt;‚ÄúPuzzling Basics‚Äù (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, so feel free to skip around, stop reading midway through, or bookmark this to read only after you‚Äôve spent more time solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-a-puzzlehunt&#34;&gt;What is a Puzzlehunt?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;puzzlehunt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an event where people, usually in teams, solve a series of &lt;strong&gt;puzzles&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a very useful definition. The more interesting question is, what is the kind of ‚Äúpuzzle‚Äù&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that appears in a puzzlehunt? The concept of a puzzlehunt puzzle is fuzzy and difficult to define precisely. Just about any hard rule one might try to state will be broken by some puzzle, sometimes deliberately. Still, here are some common features of puzzlehunt puzzles:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cook Like You&#39;re Not on MasterChef</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/cook</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2019 00:37:43 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/cook</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;series&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;part of the ‚Äúwhat I learned after four years at MIT‚Äù series, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was very young, I thought cooking was easy. I sliced plastic vegetables with a toy knife and then Velcroed them back together, ad infinitum. For at least some time, I wanted to be a chef when I grew up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was slightly less young, I thought cooking was hard. My reference points were mostly (1) my parents, who seemed to know how to make a million different dishes in inscrutable ways without thinking, and (2) MasterChef contestants (who I assume were better at cooking than my parents because they were, well, on MasterChef) messing things up and getting kicked off the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I think I probably elided some meaningful distinctions there in my youthful na√Øvet√©. Cooking food that will keep you from getting kicked off MasterChef is hard. Cooking edible food is easy.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Cooking storebought dumplings in particular is so stupidly easy it‚Äôs unfair. More generally, though, most recipes tolerate a lot of substitutions,&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; number fudging,&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and even straight-up skipping pesky instructions, like the ones in baking recipes where you mix two sets of ingredients separately in specific orders. There are reasons for those steps, but ignoring them and dumping everything into the same mixing bowl usually won‚Äôt make your results inedible. You can also just decide to omit ingredients you don‚Äôt like. Probably the least tolerant ingredient measurements in recipes are the measurements of baking soda or baking powder, which by the way are different things, in baking recipes. But otherwise you‚Äôd really be surprised how many corners you can get away with cutting ‚Äî I‚Äôve even completely winged one baking soda/powder measurement with decent results. I think this is especially important to know for people from technical backgrounds like me, who have an instinct to treat the numbers in recipes as precisely measured, painstakingly optimized choices to produce the best dish. They usually aren‚Äôt, and even if they are optimized for the recipe author‚Äôs palate, they probably won‚Äôt be optimized for yours.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And they certainly aren‚Äôt optimized for any tradeoffs you might want to make between food quality versus the time and effort you‚Äôre putting into cooking. Make the tradeoffs you want. You‚Äôre not on MasterChef.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Money Matters</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;series&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;part of the ‚Äúwhat I learned after four years at MIT‚Äù series, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs some oft-cited psychology studies that suggest that once your salary goes above $75,000, additional money doesn‚Äôt make you happier. This sounds like a sage bit of life advice if it were true, the ultimate rebuff against excessive greed and materialism and sacrificing other things for a six-digit salary, but it overstates the case a bit. &lt;a href=&#34;https://80000hours.org/articles/money-and-happiness/&#34;&gt;80,000 Hours‚Äô analysis of money and happiness&lt;/a&gt; is probably the analysis I‚Äôd trust the most here; I think it would be more accurate just to say that you get diminishing returns of happiness from salaries above $70,000.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Still, that was enough for me to decide fairly early on that I wasn‚Äôt interested in trying to get a high-paying job for its own sake, or in spending too much effort trying to invest my way to a fortune.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I wanted my job to be personally satisfying and good for the world, while paying enough for me and my family (current and future) to get by, but I planned to treat any additional money after that as little more than a bonus used for breaking ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still mostly stand by that decision today, but over the intervening years I realized there were a whole host of reasons to want money that weren‚Äôt that selfish at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Go to Class (Most of the Time)</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/go-to-class</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/go-to-class</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;series&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;part of the ‚Äúwhat I learned after four years at MIT‚Äù series, I guess? A short post this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can‚Äôt begin to count the number of times we were exhorted in high school to go to class. College is different, they said. Nobody is going to force you to go to class any more. This is what you came to college to do, what you paid so much time and money for. It‚Äôs on you to make sure you‚Äôre learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By and large I followed this advice, until I considered that I might have overcorrected given the exhortations. There are a lot of definitely bad reasons to skip class, chief among them being too lazy to get out of bed. There are also some non-obvious reasons to go to class, such as getting the professors to recognize you ‚Äî this is a reason to go to office hours even if you‚Äôre not particularly struggling with the class, or if you know people who might be able to help you that you could ask more comfortably or more conveniently; professors who know you may eventually be able to give you career advice, research opportunities, or letters of recommendation. (Of course, you shouldn‚Äôt try to befriend professors purely for these selfish motives; they‚Äôre also good to know just as fellow humans.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are also plenty of legitimate reasons to skip class. (It‚Äôs really unclear how many people out there need to hear this, but my past self did, and I want this draft out of the way-too-long queue of posts.) Here are some.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Multiplication by Juxtaposition</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/multiplication</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We interrupt the irregularly scheduled philosophical posts for some programming memes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few days, the Internet has divided itself over what the value of the expression 8√∑2(2+2) should be. Some say it should be evaluated as (8√∑2)√ó(2+2) = 16. Some say it should be evaluated as 8√∑(2√ó(2+2)) = 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the risk of belaboring the obvious, the core dispute here is not really mathematical. There is not some sequence of mathematical operations that produces some number, where mathematicians disagree about what number it produces. Instead, this is a dispute about mathematical notation: what sequence of mathematical operations the expression corresponds to the way it‚Äôs written. Specifically, it is a dispute about whether multiplication written as juxtaposition (how ‚Äú2‚Äù is written right next to ‚Äú(2+2)‚Äù) has strictly higher precedence than division. It is closer to a linguistic or typographical dispute than a purely mathematical one, and the correct answer to the dispute is that whoever wrote the expression that way should learn to write math better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This debate is not even new. The internet had fun arguing over &lt;a href=&#34;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/48293&#34;&gt;48√∑2(9+3) and 6√∑2(1+2)&lt;/a&gt;, which are functionally identical ambiguous expressions, eight years ago. I don‚Äôt know why the debate is resurging now and why we still haven‚Äôt gotten tired of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But life is short, so since we‚Äôre here anyway, let‚Äôs make some additional memes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;asking-the-computer&#34;&gt;Asking the computer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my coworkers had the idea to ask some programming languages what the answer was. The results were underwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;series&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;part of the ‚Äúwhat I learned after four years at MIT‚Äù series, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hated timed essays in high school. It‚Äôs pretty clear if you skim that part of the blog archives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My [SAT] essay got a 10 out of 12. It‚Äôs an essay I‚Äôd be ashamed of posting anywhere else; it‚Äôs disgustingly traditional and formulaic. [‚Ä¶] This was simply because I knew that using my normal essay-writing mindset, I‚Äôd get maybe a 3, because I‚Äôd spend the first twenty minutes debating myself over which side I was on and rewrite the introduction ten times. Too bad. I wasn‚Äôt there to write a good essay; I was there to get a good score on the SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst issue is that students do not need to give in-depth explanation of anything they learned. Due to its stringent time limit, the essay portion rewards quick reckless writing much more than deep thought. [‚Ä¶] encouraging students to practice writing 25-minute essays in order to improve their college-bound skills is like encouraging people to play Grand Theft Auto in order to improve their driving skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the Grand Theft Auto analogy pretty far. I‚Äôm not proud enough of these posts to link them, but you can find them if you try. In short, past me thought timed essays rewarded writing too quickly, with a disregard not only for facts but for the opportunity to lay out your opinions and thoughts so you could clarify and revise them, which was actually the most valuable part of writing.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I conceded that the time limits made sense as a practical concession to allow you to test students‚Äô writing skills fairly,&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but I felt like there was still way too much emphasis on the raw speed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;series&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of a series of posts about what I learned after four years at MIT. We‚Äôre ramping up to deeper topics eventually, I promise. Soon‚Ñ¢.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is about things. You know, physical objects. Earthly possessions. The indispensable yet fickle chains that bind us to this plane of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a freshman I loved getting free stuff. I went into my first career fair starry-eyed, taking free pens and t-shirts and sunglasses and drawstring bags from every company that would let me; I‚Äôm sure many other MIT students have gone through the same ritual of passing. There seemed to be no downside. Besides, all the swag was probably small change for most of the companies anyway, due to VC funding or massive government contracts or whatever. So I might as well make full use of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less normally (although I have no idea by how much), I also hoarded a lot of things that naturally pop up in everyday life, the stuff that would otherwise get thrown away: extra napkins, plastic bags, produce containers, boxes, those payment envelopes that come with magazine subscriptions and exhort you to Subscribe Now To 12 Issues For 20% Off!! At some point I kept the fortune from every fortune cookie I had ever eaten in a tiny resealable bag. The rationale was basically the same: they might be useful some day&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and there was no downside.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Choose an MIT Username</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/username</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write a post after two years at college about everything I had learned. I didn‚Äôt, firstly because I didn‚Äôt make it a priority, and secondly because trying to write about everything I‚Äôve learned at MIT over any nontrivial length of time is the kind of poorly scoped endeavor that I could never complete to my own satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years came and went, and now it‚Äôs been two more years and I‚Äôve learned even more things, not to mention, actually graduated. Jeez. I tried to self-impose a deadline for the big post, but it didn‚Äôt work out. There were still too many higher priorities, most of which were also natural consequences of graduating. I also couldn‚Äôt bring myself to cut anything, because unlike most of the stuff I haphazardly throw onto this blog, I can actually imagine an audience for just about everything I wanted to write about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I decided that I would break it into lots of small posts on specific topics. This way, at least the perfectionism can‚Äôt bleed between posts too much. The first topic I wanted to write about is simple, mundane, and also fairly limited in scope itself: how to choose your MIT username.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://111.186.63.17/perf.data.gz

Environment: Ubuntu 16.04+latex&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this challenge, we get a gzipped file called &lt;code&gt;perf.data&lt;/code&gt; and a minimal description of an environment. Googling this reveals that &lt;code&gt;perf.data&lt;/code&gt; is a record format of the &lt;code&gt;perf&lt;/code&gt; tool, a Linux profiler. Installing &lt;code&gt;perf&lt;/code&gt; allows us to read &lt;code&gt;perf.data&lt;/code&gt; and see some pretty interactive tables of statistics in our terminal describing the profiling results, from which we can see some libraries and addresses being called, but they don‚Äôt reveal much about what‚Äôs going on. One hacky way to see more of the underlying data in a more human-readable way (and to see just how much of it there is) is &lt;code&gt;perf report -D&lt;/code&gt;, which dumps the raw data in an ASCII format, but this is still not that useful. (One might hope that one could simply grep for the flag in this big text dump, but it‚Äôs nowhere to be seen.) Still, from this file, we can definitely read off all the exact library versions that the &lt;code&gt;perf record&lt;/code&gt; was run against.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Olympiads: The Infinitely Overdue Retrospective</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/olympiads</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2019 16:01:01 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/olympiads</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I put this question in my FAQ, because at least two people have asked me this question, and that‚Äôs how frequent a question needs to be to be on my FAQ: I got an IMO&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gold medal in 2012, as a ninth grader, and an IOI gold medal in 2014, as an eleventh grader. I could have kept going to either, or even decided to try taking the IPhO or something, but I didn‚Äôt. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer: It was a rough utilitarian calculation. By continuing, I would probably displace somebody else who would gain more from being on an IMO/IOI team than I would. Besides, I wanted to do other things in high school, so I wasn‚Äôt losing much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the short answer actually captures most of my thinking when I made the decision back then, and it‚Äôs not really new; I said as much at &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/time&#34;&gt;the end of 2013&lt;/a&gt;. But behind it was a lot of complex thoughts and feelings that I‚Äôve been ruminating over and trying to put into words for the better part of a decade. Hence, this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a natural question that precedes the frequently asked one that I have never been asked, something I am now realizing I never honestly asked myself and never tried to answer deeply: Why did I participate in the IMO and the IOI in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2019 MIT Mystery Hunt</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/2019-hunt</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/2019-hunt</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(this post is sketchily backdated from February 2020)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth year with ‚úà‚úà‚úà Galactic Trendsetters ‚úà‚úà‚úà. Past: &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/2018-hunt&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/january&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/whoosh&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;, writing with Random in &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/hunt&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;). Evidently I was unable to find the time or motivation to blog about this, and I can‚Äôt remember any particularly good stories, so let me just slip this backdated list post in the archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme in a few sentences: The hunt organizers declare a new Molasses Awareness Day, but because they didn‚Äôt follow the proper procedure, throwing the world of Holidays into chaos, where ‚Äúchaos‚Äù means molasses. This resulted in lots of puzzle-to-meta matching, since puzzles were in Holiday towns but metas were at lampposts between two towns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights of puzzles I solved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Good Walk Spoiled&lt;/strong&gt; (Holi): Happens to be about a topic I know well and find interesting. Fun steps. Justified use of substitution ciphers; the pasting into quipqiup was worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State Machine&lt;/strong&gt; (President‚Äôs): A one-aha! one-step puzzle. Maybe more unfortunate because apparently this was not the only puzzle to use a specific aspect of a specific source material, but I didn‚Äôt know about that other puzzle so it‚Äôs fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clued Connections&lt;/strong&gt; (Pi): I went to sleep near the end of this puzzle, so I didn‚Äôt see it through, but Floorpi was collectively called out by it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I Can‚Äôt Deal with These Endless Numbers&lt;/strong&gt; (Patriot‚Äôs): Incredible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loaded&lt;/strong&gt; (Arbor): Simple and self-contained enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pretty torn between this and ‚ÄúThe Future Soon‚Äù as the Year-End Song on this blog, but in the end I think I feel more threatened by the bland existence of the soulless adult than inspired by the starry-eyed-idealism-with-misogynist-undertones of the twelve-year-old, plus I get to show you the best kinetic typography video I have ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway through 2018 I thought this would be the year of ephemeral phases. I felt like I went through a different phase every month ‚Äî &lt;a href=&#34;https://dominion.games/&#34;&gt;Online Dominion&lt;/a&gt; in April, crosswords in June, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Connect&#34;&gt;Only Connect&lt;/a&gt; in July, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jonathancoulton.com/&#34;&gt;Jonathan Coulton&lt;/a&gt; in August, a brief stint of trying really hard to barre my guitar chords in October. Somewhere in the middle, I discovered Kittens Game (‚Äúthe Dark Souls of Incremental Gaming‚Äù) and my summer internship mentor got me to pick up Pok√©mon Go again. A few intense periods of typographical study were interspersed, which involved watching the above music video dozens of times, teaching a Splash class on typography, and developing a new awareness of how &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenir_%28typeface%29&#34;&gt;Avenir&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;. During the last month, I went hard on &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/&#34;&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; and got second place, apparently the only person to make it on every single leaderboard. I also did a related &lt;a href=&#34;https://kara71.github.io/Advent-of-Golf-2018/&#34;&gt;golf side contest&lt;/a&gt; and poured a couple more hours into &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/betaveros/paradoc&#34;&gt;Paradoc&lt;/a&gt;, my personal golfing language, for rather unclear gain. At least I got a lot of GitHub followers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would turn out, though, that a lot of these phases had more staying power than I expected. Pok√©mon Go is a much better game than it was two years ago and has actually fostered a significant real-life community, which seems like one of the best possible outcomes of an augmented reality game, and I‚Äôve found a steady pace to play at. I spread the Only Connect bug and people on my hall, intrigued by the format but annoyed by the overwhelmingly British trivia&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, started writing and hosting full games for each other, with our own MIT-slanted set of trivia. One of us developed a custom &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/krawthekrow/pi-connect&#34;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/krawthekrow/pi-connect-maker&#34;&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; to host these games. It took me a while to warm up to Jonathan Coulton‚Äôs latest album, but since it happened, I cannot get &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXuxwWm4huM&#34;&gt;Ordinary Man&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vig5byZx2Ew&#34;&gt;Sunshine&lt;/a&gt; out of my head; I‚Äôm still listening to JoCo as I finish typing up this post. Although I never got back to the peak of my crossword frenzy, I still study crosswordese from time to time and compose crosswords for some special occasions, like &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/misc/christmas-somewhere.puz&#34;&gt;this one (.puz file)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The academics and technical aspects of this year have all blurred together, but I think my interests are finally crystallizing:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>React and Redux the Hard FP Way</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/react-redux</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 16:44:20 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/react-redux</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A more accurate but less informative title for this post would be ‚ÄúHow I wish React and Redux were explained to me‚Äù. Note that this does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; imply that this method of explanation is suitable for anybody else. I suspect it won‚Äôt be for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to learn React and Redux the past summer for my internship at MemSQL, and there were hundreds of articles that explain React and Redux in addition to the (fine) built-in documentation, but none of them scratched the itch; I wanted to know what was going on completely, including some of the technical details and the philosophy I ought to be following, as well as efficiently. I did not need another explanation about how to think functionally, in JavaScript types or with immutable data. React‚Äôs chapter on &lt;a href=&#34;https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html&#34;&gt;Conditional Rendering&lt;/a&gt;, for example, felt so inefficient ‚Äî I know what &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements and conditional expressions are, and I know how to refactor complicated subexpressions into variables‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here‚Äôs the guide I wish I had. I think. It‚Äôs been months since I started it (as usual, for posts on this blog) and it is probably incomplete. However, I haven‚Äôt written React/Redux deeply in a while, so I didn‚Äôt have much motivation to continue to investigate the incomplete bits; and the perfect is the enemy of the good, so here it is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve burrowed ourselves deep within the facility, gaining access to the programable logic controllers (PLC) that drive their nuclear enrichment centrifuges. Kinetic damage is necessary, we need you to neutralize these machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access this challenge at &lt;a href=&#34;https://wargames.ret2.systems/csaw_2018_plc_challenge&#34;&gt;https://wargames.ret2.systems/csaw_2018_plc_challenge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A much belated post. This is a pwn challenge on a custom online wargaming platform. We are provided with the assembly of what‚Äôs ostensibly a programmable logic controller (PLC) for a centrifuge in a nuclear reactor. The challenge looks like it‚Äôs still up, so you can take a look and follow along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming&#34;&gt;ROP&lt;/a&gt; (okay, spoiler, it‚Äôs a ROP) I ever pulled off live during an actual CTF, which I was pretty excited about. The web platform meant I had to worry less about setup, and even though some of the tools it provided were a little lacking (no gdb shortcuts like &lt;code&gt;until&lt;/code&gt;, no pwntools utilities for packing/unpacking numbers, ‚Ä¶ no &lt;code&gt;one_gadget&lt;/code&gt;), I think they ultimately made the whole thing a lot more educational for me, so kudos to the folks behind it. I‚Äôve included a brief description of all the exploit techniques that lead up to ROP when we get to that, so hopefully this post will be useful even if you don‚Äôt know much about pwning binaries. The prerequisites would be some knowledge with x86 assembly, how executables are loaded into memory, and how to use &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt; (or fictionalized web knockoffs thereof).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The villains are communicating with their own proprietary file format. Figure out what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ nc proprietary.ctfcompetition.com 1337&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get a server that will talk to us on a port and a &lt;code&gt;flag.ctf&lt;/code&gt; file that‚Äôs definitely not a binary. It‚Äôs a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box&#34;&gt;black-box&lt;/a&gt; reversing challenge! I was @-mentioned as the person who might want to due to solving bananaScript (CSAW CTF Quals 2017) as a black box, although that gave a binary that it was possible in theory to reverse. Here black-box reversing is the only option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first few lines of input that the server wants, it responds with quite helpful error messages to help you appease it. If the first line you give it is not &lt;code&gt;P6&lt;/code&gt;, it complains:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You discover this cat enthusiast chat app, but the annoying thing about it is that you‚Äôre always banned when you start talking about dogs. Maybe if you would somehow get to know the admin‚Äôs password, you could fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This challenge is a simple chat app written in NodeJS. The home page redirects you to a chat room labeled with a random UUID. Anybody can join the same chat room with the URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/cat-chat-0.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fresh Cat Chat room&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a chat room, you can chat and issue two commands, &lt;code&gt;/name&lt;/code&gt; to set your name and &lt;code&gt;/report&lt;/code&gt; to report that somebody is talking about dogs. After anybody in the chat room issues &lt;code&gt;/report&lt;/code&gt;, the admin shows up, listens for a while, and bans anybody who mentions the word ‚Äúdog‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two more commands, &lt;code&gt;/secret&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/ban&lt;/code&gt;, which are in the server source code and also described in comments in the HTML source if you didn‚Äôt notice:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;You stumbled upon someone‚Äôs ‚ÄúJS Safe‚Äù on the web. It‚Äôs a simple HTML file that can store secrets in the browser‚Äôs localStorage. This means that you won‚Äôt be able to extract any secret from it (the secrets are on the computer of the owner), but it looks like it was hand-crafted to work only with the password of the owner‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge consists of a fancy HTML file with a cute but irrelevant animated cube and some embedded JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The hardest challenge of not very many I solved in this CTF. What a struggle! I have a long way to improve. It was pretty fun though. (I solved ‚ÄúYou Already Know‚Äù, and got the essence of ‚Äúghettohackers: Throwback‚Äù, but didn‚Äôt guess the right flag format and believe I was asleep when they released the hint about it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge consists of a simple PHP script that opens a MySQL connection and then feeds our input into a custom PHP extension &lt;code&gt;shellme.so&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb1&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode php&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode php&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-1&#34; title=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;$link&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;mysqli_connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;localhost&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shellql&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shellql&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shellql&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-2&#34; title=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-3&#34; title=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;isset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;$_POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shell&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-4&#34; title=&#34;4&#34;&gt;{&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-5&#34; title=&#34;5&#34;&gt;   &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;strlen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;$_POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shell&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;= &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-6&#34; title=&#34;6&#34;&gt;   {&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-7&#34; title=&#34;7&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;$_POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shell&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-8&#34; title=&#34;8&#34;&gt;      shellme&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;$_POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shell&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-9&#34; title=&#34;9&#34;&gt;   }&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-10&#34; title=&#34;10&#34;&gt;   &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-11&#34; title=&#34;11&#34;&gt;}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension basically just executes &lt;code&gt;$_POST[&#39;shell&#39;]&lt;/code&gt; as shellcode after a strict SECCOMP call, &lt;a href=&#34;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html&#34;&gt;prctl&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.16.8/source/include/uapi/linux/prctl.h#L68&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.1/source/include/uapi/linux/seccomp.h#L10&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). This means that we can only use the four syscalls &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;exit&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;sigreturn&lt;/code&gt;, where the latter two aren‚Äôt particularly useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/shell_this.png&#34; alt=&#34;Disassembled innermost function of interest in shellme.so&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Disassembled innermost function of interest in &lt;code&gt;shellme.so&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to read the flag from the open MySQL connection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This challenge is a video of somebody‚Äôs messy desk, with what is apparently the audio from a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwnI0RS6J5A&#34;&gt;Futurama clip&lt;/a&gt;. The desk is indeed extremely messy and full of things that aren‚Äôt particularly useful for us, but close examination reveals a QR code reflected in the globe in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is all about getting that QR code. After trying our best to clean up the image, we ended up with this:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pupper/Doggo</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/doggo</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 May 2018 13:52:52 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/doggo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are presented with a big zip file of SML code, which implements an interpreter for a small ML-like language with a form of taint analysis in its type checker, called &lt;em&gt;Wolf&lt;/em&gt;. Concretely, every type in Wolf‚Äôs type system has an associated &lt;em&gt;secrecy&lt;/em&gt;: it is either ‚Äúprivate‚Äù or ‚Äúpublic‚Äù, and in theory, the type system makes it impossible to do any computation on private data to get a public result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a CTF, so the challenge is all about breaking the theoretical guarantees of the type system. When we submit code, it‚Äôs evaluated in a context with a private integer variable &lt;code&gt;flag&lt;/code&gt;; our code is typechecked, executed, and printed, but only if its type is public. The goal is to break the type system and write code that produces a public value that depends on &lt;code&gt;flag&lt;/code&gt;, so that we can exfiltrate &lt;code&gt;flag&lt;/code&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, there are three progressively harder Wolf problems, named Pupper, Doggo, and Woofer. Doggo and Woofer are each encrypted with the flag of the challenge before it, so that you need to solve them in order (unless you can somehow blindly exploit servers running SML programs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wolf-overview&#34;&gt;Wolf Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs first go over the Wolf syntax and semantics. (There are small differences between the three problems, but they‚Äôre syntactically identical and only semantically differ in cases that we‚Äôll naturally get to.) The &lt;code&gt;examples&lt;/code&gt; folder has some examples of valid code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb1&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode ml&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode ocaml&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-1&#34; title=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; x = (&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; :&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-2&#34; title=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>On #DeleteFacebook</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/on-delete-facebook</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2018 20:09:37 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/on-delete-facebook</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It feels a little surreal watching #DeleteFacebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, despite how hard it is to keep an issue trending in today‚Äôs fast news cycle, this issue has managed to continue burning for a while. Somewhat recently (March 21), we got two high-profile Facebook account deletions from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/brianacton/status/976231995846963201&#34;&gt;Brian Acton (WhatsApp cofounder)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/23/elon-musk-deletes-own-spacex-and-tesla-facebook-pages-after-deletefacebook/&#34;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;. Other apparent examples include &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/03/28/playboy-dumps-facebook-amid-public-furor-over-users-data-leaks/465156002/&#34;&gt;Playboy and Cher&lt;/a&gt;, or see &lt;a href=&#34;http://time.com/money/5220854/delete-facebook-celebrities-companies-cutting-ties-privacy/&#34;&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnet.com/news/several-companies-and-people-are-pulling-back-from-facebook/&#34;&gt;CNET&lt;/a&gt; for a few more. Facebook‚Äôs U.S. and Canada user base &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.recode.net/2018/1/31/16957122/facebook-daily-active-user-decline-us-canda-q4-earnings-2018&#34;&gt;declined for the first time last quarter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, for me and for a lot of people, the scandal just doesn‚Äôt seem that qualitatively different from things we‚Äôve known about Facebook for a long time ‚Äî its stance on privacy, its psychological effects, its willingness to manipulate the user experience. Why is this time different? (Here‚Äôs the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/87u9ro/why_is_everyone_all_of_a_sudden_mad_at_facebook/&#34;&gt;/r/NoStupidQuestions thread.&lt;/a&gt; I don‚Äôt actually know which answer I believe the most.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this time really different? I‚Äôm not optimistic. The decline could simply be Facebook running out of potential users to add and space to grow. According to a recent Raymond James survey, about half of surveyed users did not plan to change how much they used Facebook, while only 8% would stop using it, and this may still be an overestimate of people who will actually leave or delete their accounts.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Mark Zuckerberg himself &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/mark-zuckerberg-q-and-a.html&#34;&gt;told the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve seen a meaningful number of people act on [the #DeleteFacebook campaign]‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I myself have to admit upfront that, even though I &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/me-and-facebook&#34;&gt;barely use Facebook any more&lt;/a&gt; and have carefully contemplated deleting my Facebook account for a long time, I still haven‚Äôt pulled the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? What will it take to change this?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2018 MIT Mystery Hunt</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/2018-hunt</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:39:22 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/2018-hunt</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My third MIT Mystery Hunt with ‚úà‚úà‚úà Galactic Trendsetters ‚úà‚úà‚úà (also see: &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/january&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/whoosh&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;, writing with Random in &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/hunt&#34;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;). It was a good hunt with a fun theme, solid puzzles, and extraordinary production quality, marred only by a fickle unlock structure and a handful of unnecessarily involved extractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we had been told the hunt would be smaller than past years‚Äô (now a controversial statement since the coin was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; found particularly early) and we didn‚Äôt particularly want to win (yet), part of our team temporarily split off this year to hunt as Teammate. Based on our Discord channel, ‚úà‚úà‚úà Galactic Trendsetters ‚úà‚úà‚úà had 75 people this year, including remote solvers and people who dropped in and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short description of the hunt structure: This year‚Äôs hunt theme was &lt;em&gt;Inside Out&lt;/em&gt;, the Disney movie about anthropomorphized emotions. This was revealed through a kickoff that demonstrated the hunt‚Äôs extraordinary production quality, in which we watched the unveiling of the Health &amp;amp; Safety hunt, first directly, then in the Control Room with the emotions of a distraught hunter (Miss Terry Hunter) and a lot of beautiful memory orbs and scenery. After Terry‚Äôs emotions became overwhelmed in response to the theme, we had to help her emotions to allow her to complete the Health &amp;amp; Safety hunt. The intro round took place in the Control Room; we had to solve 34 regular puzzles and five metapuzzles (somewhat overlapping, with some regular puzzles belonging to more than one metapuzzle) to help each of the five emotions get back to the Control Room. The rest of the hunt consisted of recovering memory orbs from each of four Islands of Personality, each of which had its own theme and meta structure, and which we could choose the unlock order of.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think this is the right video for this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lX44CAz-JhU&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the music and the animation. The music video spells out the central conceit somewhat explicitly, but I think the lyrics by themselves have a hint of ambiguity ‚Äî is it a harmful addiction that you just can‚Äôt escape from, or an essential part of your identity that you just can‚Äôt deny?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What parts of me can I just not deny, huh? Unfortunately 2017 is also the year I decide my online presence should probably be a little more professional, so you might have to read between the lines a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Okay, this post is backdated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disassembling the executable produces a huge amount of code. There are some basic obfuscations like a lot of trivial identity functions nested in each other, and a few functions that wrap around identity functions but just add some constant multiple of 16. Most of the meat is in one very large function, though. If you disassemble this function with IDA, you see a lot of variable initializations and then a lot of interesting loops that are quite similar:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thoroughly Stripped</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Woo, first CTF writeup. I got the opportunity to participate in the 2017 CSAW CTF finals with Don‚Äôt Hack Alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dumped by my core, left to bleed out bytes on the heap, I was stripped of my dignity‚Ä¶ The last thing I could do was to let other programs strip me of my null-bytes just so my memory could live on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are provided with a core dump. Examining the flavor-text and the dump, we notice that the dump has no null bytes; we conjecture that they have been stripped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we examine the hexdump and look for any clues. There are a bunch of ASCII strings, but they look like normal debugging symbols. One thing that jumps out is that there are a couple fairly convincing regular striped patterns that become vertically aligned if you display 20 bytes in each line. Once we do that, we notice the following section. (This dump is from &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/betaveros/xxb&#34;&gt;xxb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; but &lt;code&gt;xxd -c 20 thoroughlyStripped&lt;/code&gt; is quite sufficient.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first post on this blog after I migrated off WordPress for a static solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I wanted to set things up on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which was an adventure. There are lots of online posts about how to do this, but Amazon‚Äôs services change quickly and there was often outdated information. For instance, Amazon had a wizard that led you through setting up a static site, which I clicked on. It helpfully handled a lot of grunt work, but now I was out of sync with all of the guides. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think things are confusing partly because there are four AWS components all interacting to make a static site happen:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I guess I lied in my penultimate post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm planning on migrating my primary blog (again), off WordPress to a static site hosted somewhere. I might just throw everything onto GitHub Pages, or might follow any of the zillions of tutorials on how to host static sites off a cheap Amazon S3 bucket ‚Äî I haven‚Äôt decided yet, but no longer having to rely on the free part of freemium services is fairly liberating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Lots of small reasons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr: I don‚Äôt use Facebook much. If you want to contact me, I would prefer nearly any other mode of communication. I am also going to stop autosharing posts from this blog onto Facebook. RSS readers are great; get yours today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I checked Facebook and it said something like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve added N friends this past T units of time! Thanks for making the world more connected!‚Äù and I just couldn‚Äôt any more. Facebook friends are not friends. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar&#39;s_number&#34;&gt;Dunbar‚Äôs number&lt;/a&gt; is around 150, maybe double that if you want to stretch it; humans cannot handle that many human relationships. Facebook‚Äôs siloed ecosystem is the opposite of connected with the rest of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is one of many reasons I pretty much don‚Äôt use Facebook any more. This is not new, but I‚Äôve never formalized it. Also, I figure others might assume otherwise since I still do have an account and still accept friend requests and post sometimes. Thus, I‚Äôm writing this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are all of the reasons:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs some point in the decline of a blog‚Äôs activity at which you just can‚Äôt apologize with a straight face for not posting any more. Only ironically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I brainstormed reasons why I‚Äôm not blogging. It took a while for me to find a reason that felt right, but I think it‚Äôs mostly the concern that I don‚Äôt have anything important to say, and I‚Äôm just spamming people‚Äôs inboxes or Facebook feeds. I make fun of my perfectonist tendencies, but they haven‚Äôt gone away and have been exacerbated by how public this blog feels now. There‚Äôs also a general feeling permeating life that I should be trying to present myself professionally to people, because like a diamond, the Internet is forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I guess January is puzzles month</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And it‚Äôs not even January any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thing negative two: Thing zero, which is at the bottom of this post, contains two puzzles by me. Skip there if that sounds interesting and text walls don‚Äôt.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thing negative one: I abandoned this blog (again). The last month has been a mess and much of it is political stuff of the sort that I‚Äôm the worst/slowest at writing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thing one: I was on-site for a second MIT Mystery Hunt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me like lots of people want this year to be over. Among all the other things, 2016 is also apparently the year I totally abandon this blog and put off certain planned posts by several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this is what happens when you take five technical classes at MIT. The extracurriculars aren‚Äôt helping. And the fastest and most confident writing I do is still reactive, when there‚Äôs an externally-imposed deadline or when ‚Äúsomebody is wrong on the internet‚Äù. This blog isn‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, time to make up for it in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened this year? I‚Äôll start with some serious categories:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is two days late and it‚Äôs not even the post that was supposed to be here. That will have to wait until I‚Äôm less hosed. &lt;a href=&#34;https://esp.mit.edu/&#34;&gt;ESP&lt;/a&gt; just finished running Splash, our largest annual event in which thousands of high school students come to MIT‚Äôs campus, and MIT community members (mostly) teach whatever they want to the students. This was the first big program I participated really deeply in as an ESP admin, and it has this way of eating you alive and spitting you out full of joy and immersion in life but devoid of energy and buffer zones for finishing other things by their deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, thanks for all the birthday wishes from everyone everywhere. I‚Äôm sorry I haven‚Äôt found the time to respond or sometimes reciprocate. This made my day, and probably last couple of weeks too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>It&#39;s Complicated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On November 8th, 2016, Donald Trump was elected the 45th President of the United States. Along with a Republican House and Senate majority, to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world around me is still hurting and reeling from the shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, I am scared. I am scared of the policies and executive orders and legal decisions to come that may strip away many civil rights and send the environment down a worse track faster than anyone expected, and I‚Äôm barely in any of the groups that have the most to lose. I have no idea what it‚Äôs like to go through this as any of you. I am sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am also scared that this fear is driving my friends and my community away from talking to the people we need to talk to if we want to make sure this doesn‚Äôt happen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve heard a lot of people vilify Trump and Trump supporters. &lt;a href=&#34;https://nmnnmnnmmnnnmnrnmnmnnmn.wordpress.com/2016/11/09/1067/&#34;&gt;Anecdotally, so have others&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs an understandable reaction, but a fragile one. 60 million people voted for Trump. &lt;a href=&#34;http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/11/its-going-to-be-okay.html&#34;&gt;Quoting &lt;em&gt;Wait But Why&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ‚Äú[P]eople with kids and parents and jobs and dogs and calendars on their wall with piano lessons and doctors appointments and birthday parties written in the squares. Full, three-dimensional people who voted for what they hope will be a better future for themselves and their family.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People voted for Trump. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs &lt;a href=&#34;http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-base-is-blue-collar-his-voters-looking-for-a-return-to-better-times/&#34;&gt;FiveThirtyEight profiling a few blue-collar voters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/08/a-new-theory-for-why-trump-voters-are-so-angry-that-actually-makes-sense/&#34;&gt;The Washington Post interviewing an author who spent a lot of time in rural Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/us/politics/the-women-who-helped-donald-trump-to-victory.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;amp;smtyp=cur&#34;&gt;The New York Times on women&lt;/a&gt;. If the articles‚Äô reasons for voting Trump could be summarized in one word, it would certainly be ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then FiveThirtyEight tempers it a little bit with this reminder that &lt;a href=&#34;http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/&#34;&gt;Trump‚Äôs supporters are on average more well-off than others&lt;/a&gt;. Here‚Äôs &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/11/george-saunders-goes-to-trump-rallies&#34;&gt;The New Yorker visiting a bunch of Trump rallies&lt;/a&gt;.

I am not going to go any deeper into this rabbit hole. Then here‚Äôs &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/03/trump-voters-are-not-angry-about-economy-really&#34;&gt;Mother Jones arguing against the economy being a big factor at all&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/15/13286498/donald-trump-voters-race-economic-anxiety&#34;&gt;Vox saying it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; about racial resentment&lt;/a&gt;. Here‚Äôs &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-11-11/revenge-of-the-deplorables&#34;&gt;Bloomberg on the Clinton campaign‚Äôs failure to persuade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://thefederalist.com/2016/11/11/how-jon-stewart-and-the-daily-show-elected-donald-trump/&#34;&gt;The Federalist on ‚Äúhyper-liberal late-night comedy‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/9/donald-trump-and-the-new-american-revolution/&#34;&gt;The Washington Times on Trump‚Äôs optimism&lt;/a&gt;. I could find hundreds more out there just by Googling, and so could you; and chances are if you‚Äôre enough of a voracious reader to be reading my humble blog, you‚Äôve already read some of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs complicated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Time, Money, and All That Good Stuff: Part 1 of ‚àû</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had this 5,000-word draft, but I half-abandoned it for being sappy, boring, pointless, and impossible to rewrite to be satisfactorily un-cringeworthy. Instead, let me just tell you a couple random stories and anecdotes that went somewhere near the start. Maybe posting them will motivate me to salvage something from the 4,500 words that go after it and post it. Eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, Namecheap had a discount, so I bought a domain name for 88¬¢. Unfortunately, the discount only lasted for one year; afterwards, it would cost $29/year to renew. Even though I bought it on a whim and didn‚Äôt have much use for it, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect&#34;&gt;found myself wanting to keep it more and more&lt;/a&gt; and had a huge mental struggle over whether I could afford it, because wow, $29 is a lot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, during the same school year, more or less:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Musings on Time Pressure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hate doing things under time pressure, but I have to admit I do a lot more things when time pressure exists. One of the things is writing. Another is posting the things I write. They aren‚Äôt very good, but they‚Äôre better than writing that doesn‚Äôt exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(in case you forgot, I‚Äôm still posting this pretty much only because &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/no-excuses&#34;&gt;I made myself post once every weekend&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs interesting that I can impose time pressure on myself by declaring commitment devices by fiat and it works. Other people have developed other methods of doing this ‚Äî I recently discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.themostdangerouswritingapp.com/&#34;&gt;The Most Dangerous Writing App&lt;/a&gt;, which puts time pressure on you to type every five seconds or it deletes everything you wrote. There are many other ways it‚Äôs done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;content warning: death, existential dread, the usual&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have this memory ‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a tiny kid, lying in bed and trying to fall asleep, and I started thinking about death and nonexistence, and I thought about how one day I wouldn‚Äôt exist any more, that there wouldn‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; a me thinking my thoughts and perceiving my perspective, and suddenly I was terrified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got up and knocked on my parents‚Äô bedroom door and asked them about this. Maybe. Or maybe I didn‚Äôt because the fear was less crippling than the social awkwardness of randomly knocking on my parents‚Äô door in the middle of the night to ask them a question like that; I don‚Äôt remember. It was a long time ago, okay?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first made myself commit to posting weekly, I was trying to make myself spend a little time every day of the week thinking and writing and whittling away at old drafts. Instead I‚Äôm here at 10:40 PM basically starting a brand-new post. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I last &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/music&#34;&gt;blogged about music in 2013&lt;/a&gt;. I tagged two other posts with ‚Äúmusic‚Äù since then, but neither is particularly deep: &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/8-songs&#34;&gt;8 Songs for 18 Years&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/drop-in&#34;&gt;Drop-In Filler&lt;/a&gt;. Let‚Äôs continue the tradition of self-analysis part IIs from nowhere‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I meditated a little bit in &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/conversations&#34;&gt;Conversations&lt;/a&gt; about ‚Äúlacking experience or interest in a lot of the commonly discussed culture.‚Äù I think this applies to me and music as well, although not as fully. Back in Taiwan, when mentally bracing myself for coming to the U.S. for college, I sometimes worried about not knowing enough about pop music and bands and not listening enough to popular albums, and having trouble integrating into the culture for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, among the communities I wandered into and friends I made, it was a more frequent obstacle that I didn‚Äôt know enough about classical music and composers. Whoops. Some of the names rang faint bells from either music class or conversations with high school friends who did do classical music, but I could not identify or remember any styles or eras, and would remember composers only by unreliable first letters or unusual substrings of their names.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs another weekend, isn‚Äôt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm out of deep things to say. I don‚Äôt usually have deep things to say. Sorry to anybody who subscribed hoping for more things like the last post. This is basically going to be a personal stream of consciousness post. But it‚Äôs a stream with a long ancestry, since I apparently wrote 400 words about it in a WordPress draft four years ago. This was way back before I even started writing post drafts in Markdown on my computer instead of directly in WordPress, so I guess it must be an interesting topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, Brian&lt;sub&gt;2012&lt;/sub&gt; was suddenly struck by how many of the people he knew were such serious gamers. But let‚Äôs go back even earlier, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long long time ago, when I was in elementary school or so, my parents had some sort of reward system where I had to do productive things, like study or do chores or write diary entries or practice the piano or something, to earn time on the computer for games. ‚ÄúGaming time‚Äù was a currency. I enjoyed saving up lots of thirty-minute increments and knowing I had the freedom to using them slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That much I remember; the details of how it worked are very fuzzy and I‚Äôm not sure what I played in those thirty-minute increments either. I think there was Neopets and Runescape and Club Penguin. (My Neopets account still sees sporadic activity, because I get really really bored sometimes‚Ä¶)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I reached the highest bank account level today (after almost exactly 12 years, apparently) &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/Jb9zyWcjRw&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Jb9zyWcjRw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Brian Chen (@betaveros) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/betaveros/status/749362619044077568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 2, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>On Islam, Headlines, and Definitions</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/islam-headlines</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2016 15:29:43 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/islam-headlines</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post‚Äôs topic might be the most controversial thing I‚Äôve posted here ever. I hope the points I want to make aren‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the excuses for not blogging I came up with and then deleted while &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/no-excuses&#34;&gt;rambling about not blogging&lt;/a&gt; was that I‚Äôm getting more feelings about real-world real-person issues, things that people take heated positions on ‚Äî it‚Äôs not topics like what food I ate or what games I‚Äôm playing in fourth grade any more ‚Äî and my identity is pretty public here, so who knows what‚Äôll happen. Oh well. I‚Äôm probably just paranoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs also delayed, as the articles I‚Äôm talking about are old; the latest two news items are the shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile and then the police shooting at the Dallas rally. That was also really sad, but I don‚Äôt think I have anything insightful to say about it. Let me point you to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/black-lives-matter&#34;&gt;MIT Admissions post, ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;, and then for something a bit more optimistic out of a huge range of possible choices, &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@Mandela/my-white-boss-talked-about-race-in-america-and-this-is-what-happened-fe10f1a00726#.wtnr99lp1&#34;&gt;this Medium article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although after I started writing this post, the story about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.indiatimes.com/news/world/muslim-man-hugs-isis-militant-armed-wearing-suicide-vest-before-explosion-saves-hundreds-of-lives-258126.html&#34;&gt;a Muslim man preventing an ISIS suicide bomber&lt;/a&gt; came out, so now this is mildly relevant again. Anyway, I guess the delay is no different from how I put up life posts weeks after the life event happens. So today, I bring you two old news articles about Islam that my friends shared and discussed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Green: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/todd-green-phd/is-islam-responsible-for-_b_10449060.html&#34;&gt;Is Islam Responsible For The Orlando Nightclub Shooting?&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
King: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/king-isis-terrorists-aren-muslims-evil-men-article-1.2699463&#34;&gt;ISIS terrorists aren‚Äôt Muslims ‚Äî they‚Äôre just evil men hell-bent on carnage and destruction&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second one first, whose argument is, to be frank, weak. I think this piece from &lt;cite&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/cite&gt; by Wood, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/&#34;&gt;‚ÄúWhat ISIS Really Wants‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;, is a better-researched overview of ISIS while still being pretty readable. One caveat is that it‚Äôs somewhat old. But its central claim is quite the opposite:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most unexpectedly different facets of life during my internship has been the meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not talking about the food; it‚Äôs certainly different in a fantastic way (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/DropboxTuckShop/?fref=ts&#34;&gt;Dropbox‚Äôs food (link to Facebook page)&lt;/a&gt; is like something out of a high-end restaurant), but I knew that before coming already. Also of note is the way I started eating ‚àû% more ramen over the weekends than I did over the entire school year at MIT, because here I can‚Äôt buy that many groceries without them spoiling and am amazingly lazy in this new environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, this (deadlined, so not that well-thought-out, but whatever) post is about conversations at meals, which happen basically every lunch and some dinners when my team eats together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve never had any regular experience like it. Of course I‚Äôve had many meals at home with family, but they feel different because, well, it‚Äôs family and we have so many topics in common. I went to the same school for twelve years and we didn‚Äôt generally use a cafeteria; we just ate at our desks in our classrooms, or while doing things like attending club meetings or taking makeup tests. Sometimes if people felt like it they would push desks together to eat, but eating by oneself was totally normal. (At last, I feel like that was what it was. It seems so far away now that I don‚Äôt trust my memory, which is pretty sad‚Ä¶ I faintly suspect I would have this experience in a more stereotypical American high school. But this is mostly just based off the cafeteria in &lt;cite&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/cite&gt;, a movie I only watched in its entirety on the flight here, which is weird because I know I‚Äôve seen the ‚ÄúThe limit does not exist!‚Äù part much much earlier. /aside)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at MIT? ‚ÄúTime is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am glad for these conversations over lunch because I get to know my team more personally (and don‚Äôt have to awkwardly eat alone in the bathroom), but they‚Äôve also given me a lot of time to ponder my (lack of) conversation skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, this has been the longest silence on this blog in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can‚Äôt justify it with lack of time either. Interning at Dropbox takes up all of my weekdays, but my weekends are much freer than I‚Äôm used to. I carelessly let two weeks at home in Taiwan pass by without doing much about blogging, and once again a lot of my few blog drafts have drifted into the temporally awkward zone, being too far away from the events they are about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither is it for lack of things happening. At MIT, there was the &lt;a href=&#34;http://thetech.com/2016/06/10/senior-house-turnaround-announced&#34;&gt;Senior House turnaround and freshman moratorium&lt;/a&gt;. I can‚Äôt even begin to sum up the discussion around this issue, but I think &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@hollyhaney/an-open-letter-to-chancellor-barnhart-from-a-senior-house-resident-efc107e789ab#.a1psbheao&#34;&gt;the best response I‚Äôve read is this open letter&lt;/a&gt;. Then there‚Äôs the &lt;a href=&#34;http://seniorhouse.mit.edu/&#34;&gt;official Senior House response&lt;/a&gt;. But that‚Äôs enough links, since I imagine the chances that this issue is relevant to you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you‚Äôd need this blog to link you to them if you‚Äôre reading this are pretty low. (Then again, the chances that you‚Äôre reading this are already pretty low. Although the chances &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are reading this right now is 100%.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(I‚Äôm making random short posts to entertain certain people during spring break.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since air-dropping into this crazy cultural salad bowl of a place, I‚Äôve met a lot of people whose names get mispronounced. All sorts of long vowels and short vowels and consonants and word boundaries that jump across languages unpredictably. As a result, people often acquire nicknames or alternative names to get called by, whether actively, passively, or somewhere in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, my name is easy and boring. Now, I rather doubt I‚Äôd want an exciting name, in the sense of a name that everybody mangles in excitingly different ways. I‚Äôm not exactly dissatisfied with people calling me ‚ÄúBrian‚Äù. It just strikes me that I think I‚Äôve gone my entire life without a meaningful nickname or even meaningful derivative of my name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I‚Äôm ignoring the transposition. Why am I ignoring the transposition? I‚Äôm not sure I can rationally justify that, but thinking about it makes me cringe, which is the reason I‚Äôm delicately avoiding explicitly writing out what nickname I refer to by ‚Äútransposition‚Äù. I will just say it is rather uninspired‚Ä¶ and also, perplexingly to me, used by accident a lot‚Ä¶)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Zootopia</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/zootopia</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/zootopia</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(So. It‚Äôs spring break. Two-week-late post, and somehow by the end it‚Äôs all aboard the angst train again?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Sundays ago, I mobbed with a small group of MIT furries to watch &lt;cite&gt;Zootopia&lt;/cite&gt;, the recent highly-reputed Disney movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Before anything else, first there were the previews. I was impressed that every single one of them ‚Äî there were six or so ‚Äî was about an upcoming movie featuring anthropomorphic animals front and center. Let me see if I can remember all of them‚Ä¶ in no particular order, &lt;cite&gt;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;The Secret Life of Pets&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;The Jungle Book&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Storks&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Finding Dory&lt;/cite&gt;, and &lt;cite&gt;Ice Age: Collision Course&lt;/cite&gt;. &lt;ins datetime=&#34;2016-04-09T05:10:42+00:00&#34;&gt;edit: Oh, also &lt;cite&gt;Angry Birds&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/ins&gt; Wow, I said, they know their audience.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went into the movie with a vague impression that &lt;cite&gt;Zootopia&lt;/cite&gt; was more adult-oriented than most Disney films ‚Äî not in the naughty way, but in general making a lot of jokes and invoking a lot of parallels that I think only adults might have the experience to get. My suspicions were confirmed a few lines into the movie, where there was a joke about taxes I cracked up at but can‚Äôt imagine that children a few years younger would have found funny. If you the reader haven‚Äôt watched it, I hope that was vague enough not to ruin the start for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To be fair ‚Äî and, uh, some parts of the internet are kind of big on this fact ‚Äî the film also at one point enters a nudist colony. Fortunately (?), &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsLackAttributes&#34;&gt;Animals Lack Attributes&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humor aside, I think the movie also deals with some weighty and nuanced themes, ones that would take more life experience to fully appreciate than the themes of most Disney movies. The social commentary is very clear. Possibly bordering on too blatant for my tastes ‚Äî even though the whole movie is kind of Funny Talking Animals, there are some animal species for which it‚Äôs really easy to guess which human demographic groups they might be symbolizing, to the point where I can already imagine the other side of the debate. You won‚Äôt need a PhD in literature to figure out the parallels; you wouldn‚Äôt even need an AP English Literature class. But, I think, it still works. It‚Äôs like &lt;cite&gt;Animal Farm&lt;/cite&gt; on training wheels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on-site for the 2016 MIT Mystery Hunt. I even &lt;em&gt;solved a metapuzzle&lt;/em&gt;. This year I hunted with ‚úà‚úà‚úà Galactic Trendsetters ‚úà‚úà‚úà, the team primarily but not overwhelmingly formed from floorpi, my dorm floor. (Perhaps somewhat regrettably, I didn‚Äôt contribute to any events or runarounds or things given to HQ, unless you count attending a ‚Äúrecitation‚Äù for Student Simulator (round King Arthur, second from left).)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Also, I made this post. Has it been two weeks already? Okay, that‚Äôs not an unusual timeframe.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wow, I got to touch so many puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-spoilery comments on particularly memorable puzzles I did, which are disproportionately programming-related, if anybody wants to look at them (I am describing how to get to the puzzle from the round instead of linking because I‚Äôm lazy and links might rot but the instructions will hopefully survive archival (although turns out there‚Äôs actually a &lt;a href=&#34;http://huntception.com/toc.html&#34;&gt;table of contents&lt;/a&gt; so I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing)):&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wasn‚Äôt sure what would be the right song for 2015 until I set foot on MIT. Then it was a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KThlYHfIVa8&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do I even begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I thought cooking was hard. Then I ended up in the kitchen on the third floor of the west parallel of East Campus and had to produce something edible. So I figured out how to acquire chicken and put it in a pan with some onions and heat the whole thing up. It wasn‚Äôt even that bad! A few weeks later, I graduated to cooking in a rotation for six people. All this from a guy whose culinary abilities only went as far as frying eggs a few months ago. It‚Äôs incredible where life takes you sometimes.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I thought I couldn‚Äôt productively listen to lyrical music while doing homework, because I get distracted and/or bogged down by the feels. Turns out there‚Äôs a category of metal songs with great atmosphere and terrible lyrics that does the trick.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I had planned to suffer through introductory chemistry my freshman fall and introductory biology my freshman spring, and thereafter be done with required classes. Well, I took chemistry, but there was barely any suffering involved, and now biology fits nowhere on my freshman spring schedule.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some outlandish hopes I‚Äôd walk into college and be able to become mildly financially independent because people would throw high-paying jobs at me that I could learn from, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to happen. Life isn‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; easy!&lt;/p&gt;
Well‚Ä¶ it happened.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;incredible&lt;/em&gt; number of redacted things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve never been that kind of guy. Honest and innocent to a fault, no secrets except those arising from paranoid self-assigned concern about others‚Äô privacy: that‚Äôs me. Until this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, I can‚Äôt blog about it.&lt;/p&gt;
[redacted]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But mostly, of course, I actually graduated. The teacher-appreciation dinner happened (6/4), where I debuted my graduation song (woo!) and ate some good cake (double woo!); senior prom happened (6/7), with some awesome photos; and then, actually, the graduation ceremony. (6/10, same day I realized I had recently passed 100 starred things on GitHub.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;::looks at self:: I‚Äôm actually a college student now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every one of these stages of life seems like it should be a big deal, like I should pass through and suddenly know all the things about maturity and aspirations and life that are expected of college students, but it never happens that way.&lt;/p&gt;
At least, all things considered, I think this transition was very successful at taking my mind off the angsty side of things. This post is actually surprisingly unangsty. Sorry to disappoint if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre here for!
&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are 30 minutes until my laundry finishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 2:30 in the morning as I write this. Normal people are not awake at this time of day. It‚Äôs possible that normal MIT students are, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been meaning to blog for a while, but things happen and other things happen and still more things happen. From a state of total inexperience in the kitchen, I‚Äôve already managed to single-handedly cook six six-person meals for my co-op, not to mention all the weird meals I make for myself (which is just as well, I don‚Äôt think they are of typically mentionable caliber.) I‚Äôve already taken two exams in three of my classes and the big midterm for my fourth. Four puzzlehunts ‚Äî Simmons, aquarium, Palantir, Œ£UMS; five if you perhaps include Next Haunt. Six SIPB meetings. A few bottles of Soylent; I lost count and don‚Äôt want to check my room because that‚Äôll disturb my roommate. Œò(3000) zephyrs. And after many weekends of eye-opening group practice, tonight I have to catch a flight to Rochester, NY for ACM-ICPC regionals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As readers of this blog probably know, I am not an MITAdmissions blogger. It was kind of disappointing at the moment, but now I rarely think about it except when I come up with good reasons why I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be an MITAdmissions blogger. One reason is that I am not very good at coming up with advice that could generalize to a wide audience, even an audience only as wide as people at or coming to the &amp;lsquo;Tvte. &lt;em&gt;(There can be only one!)&lt;/em&gt; This by itself probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so bad because there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of generalizable advice to go around, but I also don&amp;rsquo;t like repeating well-known stuff. Don&amp;rsquo;t skip class, except when you really know when you&amp;rsquo;re doing, which you probably think you do when you skip class. Get enough sleep, maintain good study habits, set aside time to keep up with old friends, back up your zarking data, alternate alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks, do not forget the factor of one-half when computing the area of a triangle. You get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s only one piece of advice I can say that I believe is generalizable to any degree, and in particular I think my past self would have appreciated and also had not heard, even in passing, from any other source: Get a Sharpie.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A fun/interesting/unfortunate/fortunate consequence of the mental world model of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_(2015_film)&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Inside Out&lt;/cite&gt; (2015 Pixar film)&lt;/a&gt; (which is a great movie, and I‚Äôm saying this as a non-movie-type ‚Äî I laughed, and I cried, and just omgwtfbbq Disney/Pixar) is that imaginary friends that are capable of autonomous flight are probably immune to being forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>People are afraid of the dark
because it holds the unknown
and unknowns are scary.
But maybe it is just as frightening
if we let the light shine everywhere
and believe that because we know everything the light shines on
we know everything.
Perhaps for once
when the sun fades over the horizon
and the darkness returns in its dependable cycle
we should silence the fears
and remember
there is darkness in all of us</description>

      <title>Jam-Packed Fun and Games</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/jam</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/jam</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did I say ‚Äúfun‚Äù? That was short for function calls. Which are fun too, admittedly. Blah, I always go to such lengths to come up with snappy yet justified post titles and end up achieving neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more complimentary breakfast later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Code Jam World Finals. &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/nametag.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/nametag.jpg?w=170&#34; alt=&#34;[Google Code Jam 2015 name tag with my name and handle and country]&#34; width=&#34;170&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3374&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Let me take a moment to reflect. Seriously. I do not know how I made it this far this year. I guess I might be a top-500-ish competitive programmer globally, maybe even top-150-ish, but definitely not top-25-ish. And &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/4254486/dashboard#s=p3&#34;&gt;Log Set&lt;/a&gt;, the hard problem that got me through Round 3, doesn‚Äôt seem like it plays to my forte particularly either. It‚Äôs a bit mathy, but the math bits aren‚Äôt the hard part; I think it‚Äôs largely implementation, with one psychological hurdle where you have to realize that, because of how few distinct integers there are in S‚Ä≤, you can efficiently solve the subset-sum instances you need to produce the lexicographically earliest answer. I‚Äôm actually kind of impressed I got that. It seems like the sort of hurdle I usually get stuck on. How did this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe randomness. Maybe I was just particularly clear-minded during the round and wrote less buggy code than usual, because I had no expectation of making it whatsoever and so could look at the contest detachedly (until midway through the contest I accidentally noticed that my rank was under 20, and even then I tried very very hard not to think about it, and it kind of worked).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it happened, and now I‚Äôm here. Time to roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some emails much earlier in the Code Jam logistical process, Google had asked for ‚Äúrequests for changes and/or additions‚Äù to the software that would be installed on our competition computers, and I had sent them a long list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;br /&gt; Here are some things I‚Äôd like if they were installed, in decreasing order of priority:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The Vim plugin syntastic ( https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic )
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
a Haskell compiler (probably Haskell Platform 2014.2.0.0 https://www.haskell.org/platform/ even though it‚Äôs a year old)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
the Haskell package hdevtools ( https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hdevtools ) so that the above two may be integrated
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
(I don‚Äôt have enough Linux experience to name a specific thing to install, but command-line utilities that are the equivalent of pbcopy and pbpaste on Mac OS X, which allow me to redirect text into or out of the clipboard from the command line easily)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Of course, this is my first Code Jam and I don‚Äôt know how reasonable these requests are. Any nontrivial subset would be appreciated.

      <title>Orthogonal Planes</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/planes</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 11:13:14 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/planes</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a backlog of at least 6,000 words and still too many events to blog about, so these posts will not reflect things currently happening to me for a long, long time, except for the little blurbs on top of posts like this one when they exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I don‚Äôt have a good title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begins with an airplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/plane.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/plane.jpg?w=660&#34; alt=&#34;[View of airplane wing and clouds from airplane]&#34; width=&#34;660&#34; height=&#34;373&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3361&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Zarquon‚Äôs sake, you‚Äôre entrusting me with &lt;em&gt;my own passport and airline tickets and luggage and all this stuff I can‚Äôt even.&lt;/em&gt; I still layover people for months on end in &lt;cite&gt;Pocket Planes&lt;/cite&gt; sometimes. &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/cars&#34;&gt;(Watch the graceful descent of this reference into personally overused snowclone territory.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: Taiwan, my home for the previous twelve years, which I am now bidding farewell to for the longest time in forever (‚Ä¶which is only (‚Äúonly‚Äù?) five months, assuming I fly back for winter break as already planned). Destination: Seattle, for this year‚Äôs Google Code Jam World Finals, which I still don‚Äôt know how I managed to qualify for (more on that in later posts); and, before that, an accompanying interview for an internship that I scored as part of the bargain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I successfully get on the plane, sort some nice things to have on hand into my MIT tote bag (how did I &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; survive airplanes without keeping a tote bag on hand?), and put my backpack with the rest of my stuff into the overhead compartment. An old-ish guy who is probably Korean sits next to me. Plane takeoff is a bit delayed due to traffic congestion. Once during the flight, after an attendant passes out forms to everybody entering South Korea and I tell him I‚Äôm not, the guy asks me where I‚Äôm going and we have a short conversation. But for the most part, it‚Äôs typical airplane shenanigans. I listen to Avril Lavigne and Ellie Goulding, do a little homework, and eat the airplane food. Nothing remarkable happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until near the end of the flight: a guy in a suit shows up in the aisle and, looking at some sort of checklist, calls my name.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/puzzle-48</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At least one person wants me to post. I‚Äôm not even going to try do a life summary. It‚Äôs too hard. Let‚Äôs just say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
right now, my blog drafts contain a backlog of ~7500 words and counting;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I was not accepted as an MIT Admissions blogger, which is bad because my blogging will continue to not reach a large audience, but good because my blogging will continue to not reach a large audience. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that, because the application form wouldn‚Äôt let me submit without any media, I panickedly cranked out the following puzzle in an hour or so to attach.
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Glowstick Fragments</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/fragments</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/fragments</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/glowstick&#34;&gt;Echoes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the HSR we kill time with weird games from Kevan Davis‚Äôs &lt;a href=&#34;http://kevan.org/fdgp/&#34;&gt;Freeze-Dried Games Pack&lt;/a&gt;, mostly Thirty-One. Then we‚Äôre there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bus we kill time with karaoke, until people complain. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch at Chinese restaurant. Beach resort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend the first one and a half hours holed up in my hotel room watching television, first a quiz show where the host asks foreigners living in Taiwan questions about the country‚Äôs culture and society, then Disney and Cartoon Network cartoons. During the commercial breaks I do cryptic crosswords I had brought along. This is something I self-deprecatingly talk about for the rest of the trip, but I have no regrets because the three cartoons I watch are literally my top three guilty pleasure cartoons, &lt;cite&gt;Ben 10&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Teen Titans Go!&lt;/cite&gt;, and &lt;cite&gt;Jake Long: American Dragon&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I wander around and join some guys playing pool. I do better than I expect, once pocketing three balls in sequential moves. There is also a Kinect with a dancing game, which I also score surprisingly well at and have lots of fun playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner, in which I eat Â∞èÂç∑ (‚Äúpencil squids‚Äù?) with way way way too much wasabi. I stuff myself and walk around chatting and eventually learn there are freshly-made ÊâãÂç∑ (‚Äú&lt;i&gt;temaki&lt;/i&gt;‚Äù / ‚Äúhand roll‚Äù) downstairs. Since there‚Äôs lots of time I wait until I‚Äôm less full and eat two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group activity outside corresponds eerily to the one three years ago: shouting, dancing, waving glowsticks, arbitrary dance moves, punishment games, cooperation games, a competition where the guide gives out points that don‚Äôt matter like on &lt;cite&gt;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empty promises‚Ä¶ but okay. Class songs. (This is the explicit version. This song is well above the normal offensiveness rating of this blog and I usually prefer official videos, instead of shady lyric videos probably made from Windows Movie Maker that might get taken down, but honestly I find the pathetic execution of censorship in the VEVO version more offensive.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ins date=&#34;2019-02-05T16:58:07-0500&#34;&gt;
edit from the future: There used to be an explicit YouTube video of Shots by LMFAO ft. Lil Jon here, which has since been taken down for obvious reasons. Yes, it is a very crude song. I never went to a party that was a tenth as wild as the song describes. Maybe it was my means of vicarious escape.
&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After it we have a sentimental moment listening to ‚ÄúSee You Again‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At night our room flips through television and watches the second half of &lt;cite&gt;Iron Man 2&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[CIMC 2015 Part 3] Monsters and Pandas and Tigers, Oh My!</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/cimc-2015-part-3</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/cimc-2015-part-3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My inner perfectionist is crying that I have to post this, in particular over my pathetic &lt;a href=&#34;http://snowclones.org/2007/05/22/x-y-and-z-oh-my/&#34;&gt;snowclone&lt;/a&gt; title, but my inner pragmatist knows that, judging by my old blogging patterns, it‚Äôs now or never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18.06: 56%, haven‚Äôt touched it in a while, but I think I can do lots more on the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a non-contestant, I confess I feel totally uninvested in the results and find the Closing Ceremony boring. All contestants go up, country by country, and have their awards read off. No effort is made to make any sort of buildup to a climax. But maybe this is for the best; we don‚Äôt want anybody feeling shafted or discouraged from continuing to do math due to a mere elementary-/middle-school competition. Meanwhile, though, I‚Äôm browsing reddit on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this ceremony, the entire Taiwan delegation spends some time walking around outside while the guides make confused phone calls trying to decide where we eat lunch. My parents offer me some potato chips they bought somewhere, which are (as the label is really eager to point out) baked, not fried. Some time passes this way; eventually, the guides figure it out and we go through amazingly long queues to eat at the cafeteria, as usual. Then we are sent to a massive shopping mall for the afternoon, a place so large that its exits have number labels that go up into the double digits so that people don‚Äôt get lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take trippy failed panorama photos from the bus windows. &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/trippy-panorama.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/trippy-panorama.jpg?w=652&#34; alt=&#34;[trippy panorama of a shopping mall]&#34; width=&#34;652&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3321&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Nontopical life update: Current 18.06 homework status: 34% (mildly screwed, probably won‚Äôt finish before I leave my cozy home for the U.S. and I usually struggle to get into the mood for homework while traveling, but I guess I‚Äôll have to)) &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/18-06-1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/18-06-1.png?w=296&#34; alt=&#34;[18.06 status panel: 34%]&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (I‚Äôve been spending most of my uptime doing said homework and running errands, and my downtime catching up on &lt;cite&gt;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&lt;/cite&gt; while farming the Flight Rising Coliseum.

Day 3 (Excursions)
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morning routine snipped. We come to the middle school again to eat breakfast and gather; the contestants will be taking their tests here (accompanied by one bottle of ‚ÄúBuff‚Äù energy drink each) while the rest of us will be going on an excursion. Before this happens, though, two Taiwanese contestants ask me and Hsin-Po some math problems. There‚Äôs a geometry problem, which I fail to solve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(paraphrased) In triangle ‚ñ≥ABC, ‚à†A is 40¬∞ and ‚à†B is 60¬∞. The angle bisector of ‚à†A meets BC at D; E is on AB such that ‚à†ADE is 30¬∞. Find ‚à†DEC.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hsin-Po figures out that, once you guess (ROT13) gur bgure boivbhf privna vf nyfb na natyr ovfrpgbe naq gurl vagrefrpg ng gur vapragre, lbh pna cebir vg ol pbafgehpgvat gur vapragre naq fubjvat sebz gur tvira natyr gung gurl vaqrrq pbvapvqr.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Then, there‚Äôs a combinatorics problem in a book with a solution that they‚Äôre not sure about:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[CIMC 2015 Part 1] Rainy Days in July (and Other Months)</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/cimc-2015-part-1</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 13:48:45 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/cimc-2015-part-1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We get up at 3:40 AM. By 4 AM we have left our house, speeding like a bullet into the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Ohai. Somehow it slipped my mind that I was ending my streak by leaving the country for a competition that would likely be highly bloggable, like my last two international olympiads, both of which led to notable post sequences on this blog. (Admittedly, the first one was never really completed‚Ä¶) My only excuse was that I was worried I might not be able to access my blog from inside the Great Firewall, but I did (via vpn.mit.edu) and even if I hadn‚Äôt, I could still have drafted posts locally in Markdown as I usually do, so I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Also: because, as I‚Äôve said way too many times recently, I need to do linear algebra homework, these posts aren‚Äôt going to be as complete or as perfect as I‚Äôd like them to be. Although I‚Äôm probably just saying this to persuade myself; I tend to include many of the boring parts as well as the interesting parts of the trip, which maybe benefits my future self at the expense of other readers. I probably need to get out of this habit more if I want to blog for a wider audience, though. Oh well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;backstory&#34;&gt;
Backstory
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imc-official.org/&#34;&gt;International Mathematics Competition&lt;/a&gt; (IMC) is, &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin&#34;&gt;as it says&lt;/a&gt;, an international mathematics competition. But I should add that it is for elementary and middle-school students (in other words, I am not competing, okay??). (edit: Also, one or two letters are often prefixed to indicate the host country, for whatever reason. This year it would be CIMC, C for China.) I am tagging along because I am a student of Dr.¬†Sun, one of the chief organizers, and have been slotted to give a talk and possibly help with grading the papers and translating. My father is coming to help arrange a side event, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://dominosolver.com/&#34;&gt;domino puzzle game&lt;/a&gt; competition, which he programmed the system for; and my mom and sister are also coming to help with translation and other duties. Other people in our group: Dr.¬†Sun himself, his longtime assistant slash fellow teacher Mr.¬†Li (wow I‚Äôm sorry I forgot you while first writing this), my friend and fellow math student Hsin-Po, who is an expert at making polyhedra from origami or binder clips (and at Deemo); Chin-Ling, my father‚Äôs student/employee who also programmed lots of the domino puzzle server and possesses a professional camera; and, of course, all the elementary- and middle-school contestants, as well as most of their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever given this amount of background exposition about any event I‚Äôve attended to my not-so-imaginary audience before. It feels weird. Some part of me is worried about breaking these people‚Äôs privacy by posting this, which makes a little bit of sense but not enough for me to think that it‚Äôs actually a valid reason to avoid or procrastinate blogging. I think it‚Äôs a rationalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;
Day 1
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only interesting thing that happens at the airport is a short loud argument in the queues for luggage check-in, perhaps partly fueled by our high number of people and of heavy boxes (gifts for other countries and raw materials for Hsin-Po‚Äôs polyhedra). I don‚Äôt know whose fault it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case I fail to scale the firewall, I attempt to download Facebook on my phone for one last look before boarding, but it fails during installation twice and I give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plane is not fancy enough to offer personal screens and entertainment centers for everybody, but thankfully the ride lasts only three hours, so this is tolerable. Instead, the plane plays the second &lt;cite&gt;Divergence&lt;/cite&gt; movie on overhead screens, which I watch half-heartedly. The plot setup seems interesting but the ending seems to me to involve two Ass Pulls‚Ñ¢, although since I haven‚Äôt been paying much attention I am not confident if I just missed some foreshadowing or character development. On the flight, I also read the proof of the irrationality of powers of &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;cite&gt;Proofs from THE BOOK&lt;/cite&gt; and leaf through the magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt hear any good music on-board, except maybe ‚ÄúSpace Oddity‚Äù, which is a little freaky to be listening to while cruising at so may kilometers in the sky. Perhaps because of this, I find myself singing and humming ‚ÄúSpace Oddity‚Äù unexpectedly often over the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;arrival&#34;&gt;
Arrival
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first sign we see after alighting the plane consists entirely of characters that are the same in Simplified and Traditional Chinese ‚Äî if I remember correctly, „ÄåÂâçÊúâÂù°ÈÅìÔºåÂ∞èÂøÉÊÖ¢Ëµ∞„Äç&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Changchun airport looks like any other airport, coolly blue-themed with moving platforms. The restrooms have fancy bright purple soap. Even though I consciously think about how I have suddenly arrived in a country that places notable restrictions on freedom of speech and Internet access, I don‚Äôt feel it. Eep, what an anticlimax.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/rekt&#34;&gt;misstep on the fourth day&lt;/a&gt; I managed to post one post every day, completing the rest of the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;streak&lt;/a&gt;! This post is scheduled to go out around the time my plane takes off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd insert a &lt;cite&gt;Frozen&lt;/cite&gt; gif here if I could find a good one, but I don‚Äôt like any of the ones I found and besides, copyright is an issue. So instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMO2007.C6. In a mathematical competition some competitors are friends. Friendship is always mutual. Call a group of competitors a clique if each two of them are friends. (In particular, any group of fewer than two competitiors is a clique.) The number of members of a clique is called its size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that, in this competition, the largest size of a clique is even, prove that the competitors can be arranged into two rooms such that the largest size of a clique contained in one room is the same as the largest size of a clique contained in the other room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was my streak a success? On the bright side, I definitely generated lots of posts, many of which were radical departures from my old blogging habits:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, just one more post for the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;streak&lt;/a&gt; milking the stuff uncovered in my old hard drive, and then it‚Äôs over, I promise. Here is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://betaveros.github.io/clicker.html&#34;&gt;silly three-button idle game&lt;/a&gt; I discovered, which I apparently made in 2010 when I was a bored eighth-grader and the most recent jQuery version was 1.4.x. Instead of enjoying a text wall, please enjoy trying to get 16,384 clicks in the non-warp version. (There‚Äôs no victory message or anything; it‚Äôs just a nice round number that I reached while writing this post. And yes, I know you can call JavaScript from your developer console, or edit the source or DOM. That‚Äôs cheating.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I realize this is short even for filler posts, so if you don‚Äôt want to play an idle game, here is a remix of &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/numbers-bmp&#34;&gt;numbers.bmp&lt;/a&gt; to stare at and feel inspired by. Or disgusted with, or indignant at. Your choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Old Tests (and a Mysterious New Student)</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/old-tests</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/old-tests</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Short &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;streak&lt;/a&gt; post. And for the uninformed, I‚Äôm using &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spivak_pronoun&#34;&gt;Spivak pronouns&lt;/a&gt; for this post just because.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, when people I don‚Äôt already know through math competitions ask me or my parents about something like how to teach their intelligent child to make em really good at math, or even English or whatever, I am skeptical by default because there seem to be a lot of Taiwanese parents who have alarmingly rigid and largely baseless expectations or assumptions about what their children ought to be interested in and excel at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can lead a horse to water, and honestly I think you could find a way to force it to drink if you really wanted to, but you can‚Äôt make it enjoy the process of being force-fed. Um. &lt;a href=&#34;https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/36489/eat-is-to-feed-as-drink-is-to-what&#34;&gt;Force-watered? Force-hydrated?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can teach your child math and English, and you could make em ace all eir tests, but you probably can‚Äôt make em enjoy the test so much that e decides to create more diabolical versions of these tests to give to eir fictional characters in eir stories for fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;actual illustrations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from the old stories I mentioned in &lt;a href=&#34;https://betaveros.wordpress.com/2015/07/24/more-fiction-part-2-5/&#34;&gt;part 2.5 of ‚ÄúMore Fiction‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;. Stories I wrote in 2004. As a first-grader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is kind of horrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/test6blurred.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/test6blurred.png?w=652&#34; alt=&#34;test6blurred&#34; width=&#34;652&#34; height=&#34;458&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3231&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More Fiction (Part 2.5)</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/more-fiction-2-5</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2015 20:27:44 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/more-fiction-2-5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is not Part 3. It‚Äôs just two things I thought of tacking on to &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/more-fiction-2&#34;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can I say? Part 2s are easy blog post fodder; Part 2 appendixes are even easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One, there‚Äôs one other wall I run into often during those rare attempts when I get motivated enough to try to write a story: naming characters is hard. At least, it provides an excellent motivational roadblock whenever I even consider committing a story to paper, a point before I‚Äôve actually written anything at which I think ‚Äúmaybe I should give up and go on Facebook instead‚Äù and proceed to do so. Aggh. And I think there‚Äôs more than one reason for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I have trouble coming up with names to some degree. Sure, it‚Äôs easy to browse BabyNames.com and look for choices, but a lot of the names there are really weird and contemplating them for every unimportant character kind of rips me out of the immersed mindset.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Reading great stories in English class and elsewhere may have gotten me feeling like every name ought to be a deep meaningful allusion, or at least pun fodder. I feel like I will regret it if I write a story and, a few months and/or chapters down the road, realize I missed a better name or the name I chose has some undesirable connotations in context or provides an atmosphere-ruining coincidence.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think the real kicker is simply that some part of me is terrified of the awkwardness of giving a character the same name as anybody I know, because then they might read the story and wonder if the character is somehow based on them. And too many of the names that I consider common enough to not lure readers off into looking for hidden meanings are used up that way. This is obviously worst if the character is an antagonist. But it seems just as awkward if the character is a protagonist in accord with everything I‚Äôve written, i.e.¬†a paper-thin character blatantly created for escapist purposes. I am already kind of terrified I might ever meet anybody with the same name as one of my mentally established characters even though I haven‚Äôt actually written anything about him. And there‚Äôs a well-established convention of &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit&#34;&gt;not reusing a first name in a work&lt;/a&gt;, so this gets even harder with every work; I‚Äôm just as worried, what if somebody thinks this character is related to the other character in that story I wrote in second grade? Oh no!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs like not reusing variable names in a programming language where everything is in the same scope. Positively nightmarish.&lt;/p&gt;
And I actually discovered some evidence this is a thing in my past: I found some stories I wrote in 2004. They are possibly the most extreme exemplification of &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhatYouKnow&#34;&gt;Write What You Know&lt;/a&gt; imaginable: the main character, Michael, goes to school and makes friends. That‚Äôs all.
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;
Illustration courtesy Brian&lt;sub&gt;2004&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of want to share these stories, but fast-forward a few years and you‚Äôll see that a classmate named Michael entered my grade and we stayed in the same grade until we graduated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, Michael. You‚Äôre probably not reading this, but the character I created in 2004 is not in any way based on or inspired by you, especially not this image. And unlike later in this post where I name a character after myself, I‚Äôm not being sarcastic, really.&lt;/p&gt;
See, this is awkward.
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Throwback Thursday Puzzles!</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/tbt-puzzles</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2015 23:39:44 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/tbt-puzzles</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, there are so many cool things in my old folder. I could probably create and schedule enough filler posts to make my &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;streak&lt;/a&gt; last through my week-long trip and back. I guess I won‚Äôt, though, because I don‚Äôt want to dilute my textwall-draft brand more than necessary and there are a few text posts that I fully intend to post before leaving. Or at least one. Although on second thought, it‚Äôs possible they might actually not be as interesting as posts like this one about the adorable me from the past. As Pablo Picasso once said, ‚ÄúYouth has no age.‚Äù (Yes, I totally just went on BrainyQuote and searched for ‚Äúyouth‚Äù. Forgive me, please.) Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today‚Äôs throwback theme is old puzzles! Particularly picture ones! In reverse chronological order by last modified time, because I said so! All the image puzzles are puzzlehunty in the sense that you‚Äôre supposed to end up with a single word or short phrase as your final answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;p06pre2&#34;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;art/hidd3n/p06pre2.png&lt;/code&gt; (2010/10/31)
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/p06pre2.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/p06pre2.png&#34; alt=&#34;p06pre2&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3210&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A straightforward one to start. I have no idea what‚Äôs with the filename, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;purity2logic&#34;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;haxxor/purity2/logic.html&lt;/code&gt; (2010/10/10?)
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My file hierarchy is really weird. I don‚Äôt think this time stamp is when I wrote the puzzle because it was part of a silly static site setup I created (but never actually put anywhere), and I probably edited and regenerated stuff like the breadcrumbs many times, but it‚Äôll have to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also funny because the title of the HTML file is ‚ÄúLogic Puzzles‚Äù and the description starts, ‚ÄúThese puzzles were made when I was really bored‚Ä¶‚Äù, but there‚Äôs only one puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it‚Äôs better than an under construction page, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll quote the entirety of the old instructions as I wrote them, even though they‚Äôre really verbose, since it‚Äôs easy to scroll past them:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mom dug up an old hard drive for me to find photos of my elementary-school self participating in the same math competition I‚Äôm presenting at in a week. I discovered a lot of other interesting old stuff there. So today‚Äôs filler post image for the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;streak&lt;/a&gt; is courtesy of Brian&lt;sub&gt;2003/03/23&lt;/sub&gt;.

      <title>Translation Party</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/translation-party</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2015 23:53:12 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/translation-party</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a short anecdote for the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;streak&lt;/a&gt; today. Hmm, I guess this developed beyond being just another filler post, which is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to preparing my presentation, the other job I have to do for the math competition I‚Äôm attending in a week or so (not as a participant, okay?) is translating various guests‚Äô speeches between English and Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speeches‚Äô length and formulaicness really get on my nerves, but then again my standards for speeches were skewed upward by Richard Forster‚Äôs speeches during the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/lightsabers&#34;&gt;opening&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/xanthous&#34;&gt;closing&lt;/a&gt; ceremony of IOI 2014, but on the gripping hand I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that hard to at least &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; not to be formulaic and I really can‚Äôt see any effort on their part whatsoever. Off the top of my head, pretty much all the speeches tend to go like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Welcome!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Math is great!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
This competition is great!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The city hosting this competition is great!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The college hosting this competition is great!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
You contestants are great!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Good luck!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except each bullet point is a paragraph that lasts a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Ninja edit: Which is not to say they didn‚Äôt put any effort into their speeches at all, but that much of the effort seem misguided to me. I don‚Äôt see how anybody who has been in the audience for one of these speeches can overlook the same flaws in their own. Unless it‚Äôs like, at some point in the natural life cycle of the human brain, people spontaneously start enjoying these safe and repetitive speech topics instead of some earnest and maybe lighthearted advice and anecdotes and jokes? Like how people somehow start enjoying spicy stuff, or the bitter flavor of beer and wine, or writing teenage-angsty ranty posts complaining to nobody in particular like this one? Tough questions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. My mom actually does most of the translation but I am the grammar stickler post-processor and we work together on the hard parts. The second hardest things to translate are idioms. The hardest things to translate are quotes. It turns out that lots of people find translated quotes to Chinese and it can be incredibly difficult to reconstruct their English versions. Here is the quote that today‚Äôs story is about, which we were tasked with providing the English translation (or original) for and which the speech attributed to ÂÖãËé±Âõ† (trad.: ÂÖãËêäÂõ†).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Nope, still no meaningful post today. Instead here is a pretty diagram of the A* search algorithm (A-star in English, for my search crawler overlords). At least, I hope it is; I spent more time fiddling with the pretty colors than making sure the algorithm I implemented was actually A*. It looks right, though? In the background, red component measures traversed distance from start, (inverted) green component measures difference between the traversed distance plus heuristic distance and the theoretically optimal heuristic distance from the start, blue component measures heuristic distance to goal.</description>

      <description>Here are two screenshots of the Android 3x3 grid lock we dealt with in the phone post.


Part of the reason I don‚Äôt have a real post today and am instead writing filler for the streak is that I wanted to include this 3x3 lock in the programming presentation I‚Äôve been indirectly complaining about in the last few posts, and I couldn‚Äôt find any nicely licensed screenshots to illustrate it, so I made these screenshots myself, and then I spent somewhat more than an hour researching copyright law and listening to a talk about it before posting them.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first realized it might be helpful to start trying to remember the correspondence between MIT courses and their numbers, I expected a list of mnemonics for this correspondence would be one of those Things That Should Exist On the Internet. I‚Äôm pretty surprised it doesn‚Äôt. I mean, MIT has, what, &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.mit.edu/facts/alum-association.html&#34;&gt;at least 100,000 alumni&lt;/a&gt;; as far as I know, nearly everybody who goes there speaks the number correspondence fluently, so they have to learn it; and the science of mnemonics has been with us since the ancient Greeks and people who understand its usefulness can‚Äôt be uncommon, especially not in such a prestigious institute of higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What gives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure. Maybe it‚Äôs just that nobody has posted their mnemonic set on the Internet out of embarrassment? My mnemonics are pretty bad too, but hey, &lt;a href=&#34;https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law&#34;&gt;Cunningham‚Äôs Law&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî if you‚Äôre reading, feel free to add better ones in the comments, or to criticize my horribly unenlightened and stereotypical characterizations of your courses, to make this thing better. Or maybe it‚Äôs out of concern that nobody else will find it useful? I get that feeling but my &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;streak&lt;/a&gt; compels me to ignore it now, as it has for the last dozen posts or so. Or maybe they just didn‚Äôt optimize for search engine findability, so I can‚Äôt find it? I hope this post fixes that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I guess the most likely reason is that maybe most people don‚Äôt actually have &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the course numbers memorized with perfect recall, only the handful of most common ones they and their friends are in, and it‚Äôs perfectly fine to ask for clarification when an unknown number comes up in conversation, so nobody ever feels like they need to bother with mnemonics for every single course. Feels sensible to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway, I‚Äôm not most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most comprehensive resource of courses and numbers, including their history, appears to have once been at &lt;code&gt;http://alumweb.mit.edu/clubs/sandiego/contents_courses.shtml&lt;/code&gt;. Many, many links point there. Unfortunately, it is dead and I cannot find its new home, if it has one. Fortunately, there is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.is/xViRP&#34;&gt;archived version on archive.is&lt;/a&gt;; on the other hand, I am not sure whether any updates have occurred since it was archived. A more recent version with course populations from 2005 is &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.mit.edu/mollieb/www/blog/MIT%20course%20numbers.html&#34;&gt;this chart&lt;/a&gt; linked from the MIT Admissions blog post &lt;a href=&#34;http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/numbers_are_names_too&#34;&gt;Numbers are names too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs olympiad season. Taiwan placed 18th in the IMO rankings1. Next day there are news stories about how it‚Äôs our ‚Äúthird worst performance in history‚Äù, and commenters drawing casual arrows from changes in Taiwan‚Äôs standardized tests and curriculum to this result, and the Ministry of Education saying they‚Äôd review their procedures or something.
What.
Did you forget our performance last year? Do you think our olympiad training system is completely overhauled on an annual basis, or has even a tangential relationship with the overall education system?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr: anybody want to add me on Line or tell/remind me about other phone chat apps? betaveros as always.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, talk about uninspired post titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a new phone today. Or, well, it‚Äôs second-hand, actually. I try to make electronics last a long time, but I think this was justified given the state of my last phone‚Äôs screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/screen.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/screen.jpg?w=269&#34; alt=&#34;old phone screen, with a visibly malfunctioning black patch&#34; width=&#34;269&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3142&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, I‚Äôm going off to college and all. Anyway, the phone is pretty cool. It‚Äôs a slick shade of red, it came with a cover and everything, and it has one of those fancy 3x3-grid locks. How secure are those again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we could just &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6979524/android-lock-password-combinations&#34;&gt;find the answer on StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;, but that‚Äôs boring.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Okay, I think I‚Äôm figuring this out. When I make a filler post for the streak, it should be an unabashed filler post, so I can accumulate some of the blogging time I find each day to work on a serious post (and for doing the other important stuff I should be doing!) instead of wasting it right away.
Life. I‚Äôm programming something for Dad involving a parser using Jison, and one of the tasks involved stuffing a custom lexer into the parser.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My mom says I blog too much about myself. I am completely guilty of that and this post is mostly not an exception. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not that I wouldn‚Äôt like to write posts about others and for others. But I know more about myself so obviously there‚Äôs &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhoYouKnow&#34;&gt;more I can write about myself&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs kind of a habit, and it‚Äôs been a very personally helpful habit. I discover lots of things when I write introspectively. But I‚Äôm a very weird person and a lot of the insightful things I discover when doing this are things I doubt I can generalize to other people. I tried getting a lot of my friends to join HabitRPG when I discovered it, but it was nowhere as effective on them as it was on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else could I blog about? What else do people blog about?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Ok I give up I don‚Äôt have any material and don‚Äôt feel like preparing any because the influx of IMO problems, including the shortlist, is too fascinating. Instead, here is a joke quoted verbatim from TVTropes (CC-NC-SA).
 An American anthropologist has been studying a tribe in Africa by living with them for a year. One day, the chief called him into the chief‚Äôs hut. The chief sighed. ‚ÄúWell, my friend, it seems that we must ask you to leave.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;streak&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not any better than the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/nuclear&#34;&gt;first installment&lt;/a&gt;, but I need to post. And then, you know, do homework and presentations and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr.¬†Carver had just managed to drill past Dr.¬†Perkins‚Äôs cranium when she heard the door behind her creak open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúHa! You walked right into my trap!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned around. Dr.¬†Perkins was standing in the doorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked down. Yes, they were both Dr.¬†Perkins, she‚Äôd know that pair of glasses and spiky hair anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked up. Well, the guy in the doorway was wearing a set of black robes outside his white lab coat, but other than that, they really looked completely identical.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time Management</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All through high school I had really high standards for myself. Not the grades, mind you (I admit, humblebrag, my grades were always uncomfortably high, probably as an expected but still sad byproduct of this process (yes, I‚Äôm actually complaining about grades being too high. I don‚Äôt want my report card to have lots of Bs or Cs, but I really didn‚Äôt need to pour enough resources into schoolwork that I graduated as valedictorian, when there were so many other personally and socially meaningful things I could be dedicating effort into creating ‚Äî but that‚Äôs a subject for another post (humblebrags all the way down. Somebody get some internet pitchforks and poke some sense into me))), but simply how I managed my time for doing homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion: not very well. I always spent too much time surfing the internet and doing things less urgent than homework, then ended up sleeping at midnight or one o‚Äôclock or whenever often to finish what I should have done earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, compared to many of my friends (definitely not all, though), that‚Äôs not late at all and the amount of buffer time I had between finishing work and having it due was positively luxurious. But then, I suppose, I didn‚Äôt have the same amount of math homework. But to counter my excuse, I had additional responsibilities such as practicing olympiad problems and preparing weekend presentations and translating the school newsletter. So I don‚Äôt actually know if my workload was significantly lighter than average or not, ergo I don‚Äôt know whether my time management skills were significantly better than average or not. It seriously doesn‚Äôt feel like they would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And allegedly, even when I‚Äôm procrastinating, it‚Äôs more productive than my friends‚Äô procrastination, maybe even &lt;a href=&#34;http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html&#34;&gt;Paul Graham‚Äôs good type of procrastination&lt;/a&gt;. Often when I gripe about how much my former self procrastinated they will ask me what I‚Äôve been doing and, after hearing the answer, tell me this. What have I done to put off homework? Oh, I did some olympiad math problems, committed to my GitHub projects, read a bunch of programming blogs, organized my old chemistry notes from two years ago, and surfed the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Yeah. Total waste of time. Meanwhile certain friends surf 9GAG whenever they get the chance. (Which is not to say that I don‚Äôt procrastinate in obviously unproductive ways sometimes ‚Äî I surf reddit, YouTube, and TVTropes of course. Sometimes I even just read my own blog or dig through old folders in my computer. I‚Äôm weird. But anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

‚â•1 of you should know what is being referred to.
  Oh yeah, I love being first. Of course the approximate price is that I have to expose the world to the innocent na√Øvet√© of my fourth-grade self. So far nobody mean has ventured there yet, but who knows.   Darn, two years. Darn, Cards Against Humanity. I need more of that in my life.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/more-fiction-1&#34;&gt;Part 1 was here&lt;/a&gt;. This is still part of the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak I have openly committed to&lt;/a&gt; and standard disclaimers still apply. Just as in &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/fiction&#34;&gt;my original post&lt;/a&gt;, back to the flip side ‚Äî let‚Äôs see what I have to do to &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; fiction to my own satisfaction. And this time I have a guide: the list I made in the first part of this post. Could I create fiction I would enjoy reading?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1: I enjoy calling things before they happen‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
2: ‚Ä¶I also enjoy the Reveal for questions when the author has done something clever I didn‚Äôt catch‚Ä¶
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, obviously, I can‚Äôt predict things in my own plot. But I can develop riddles in the plot, set up expectations and drop subtle clues and use Chekhov‚Äôs Tropes. Can I?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At some point in the past, because I was a bored teenager, I memorized this.
  So now, in theory, I can tell you the capital of each state of the U.S. This is already a lame trick, but as I realized yesterday, it‚Äôs made even lamer by the fact that the data structure I chose only supports O(n) lookup.</description>

      <title>More Fiction (Part 1)</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/more-fiction-1</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/more-fiction-1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm going to do it again! I‚Äôm going to break a post into parts to milk it for the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak&lt;/a&gt;. Desperate times call for desperate measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mostly a self-analysis post though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING: &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TVTropesWillRuinYourVocabulary&#34;&gt;This post contains many, many TVTropes links.&lt;/a&gt; If you are like me and need to be productive but are &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife&#34;&gt;liable to being sucked into TVTropes&lt;/a&gt;, maybe you should find a way to commit to not clicking on any of these links, or just stop reading. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/609/&#34;&gt;obligatory xkcd&lt;/a&gt; is kind of long and also featured on one of the TVTropes links I‚Äôve already made, so I‚Äôm not going to embed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/fiction&#34;&gt;blogged about this before in 2013&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî how I felt that the analysis trained into me by English class was dulling my ability to appreciate and write the types of fiction I really enjoyed. After thinking about it I realized the mismatch goes deeper than that. Because the things I seek the most in fiction are escapism and entertainment. I like simple fiction with obvious (though maybe not &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious&#34;&gt;that obvious&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop&#34;&gt;Aesops&lt;/a&gt; and extreme economy of characters via making all the reveals being of the form ‚ÄúX and Y are the same person‚Äù (which does not quite seem to be a trope but may be an occurrence of &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConnectedAllAlong&#34;&gt;Connected All Along&lt;/a&gt;, with the most famous subtrope being &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather&#34;&gt;Luke, I Am Your Father&lt;/a&gt; (which is &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty&#34;&gt;a misquote&lt;/a&gt;!), and is also one common &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockEpilepticTrees&#34;&gt;Stock Epileptic Tree&lt;/a&gt;, so maybe this isn‚Äôt the best example), because not only are such reveals fun, they make the plot simpler. What can I say, it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The qualities of being thought-provoking or heartwarming are only bonuses for me; needless &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JigsawPuzzlePlot&#34;&gt;complexity in the number of characters or plots&lt;/a&gt; is a strict negative. Sorry, I don‚Äôt want to spend effort trying to remember which person is which and how a hundred different storylines relate to each other if they don‚Äôt build to a convincing, cohesive, and &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal&#34;&gt;Reveal&lt;/a&gt;, and often not even then. And I like closure, so I feel pretty miserable when writers &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot&#34;&gt;resolve a long-awaited plot point just to add a bunch more&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this I am ambivalent about long book series; most of my favorite works of fiction have come in long series but starting a new one always gives me &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommitmentAnxiety&#34;&gt;Commitment Anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. Even when there‚Äôs closure, when I finish an immersive movie or book I‚Äôm always left kind of disoriented, like I‚Äôve just been lifted out of a deep pool and have to readjust to breathing and seeing the world from the perspective of a normal person on land. I like when I‚Äôm reading good fiction, but I don‚Äôt like going through withdrawal symptoms. If I want to read complicated open-ended events, I‚Äôll go read a history textbook, because at least the trivia might come up useful some day; if I want tough problems I‚Äôll just look at real life and think about the possibility of college debt and having to find a job and everything. (If it wasn‚Äôt obvious yet, this is why I hyperbolically hate on &lt;cite&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/cite&gt; often.) Even worse than all of this is multiple paragraphs full of scenery and nothing else, unless of course parts or maybe all of the scenery are &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun&#34;&gt;Chekhov‚Äôs Guns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some part of me is embarrassed to admit this because I‚Äôve been educated for so long about deep literature that makes social commentary or reveals an inner evil of humanity or whatever. But then again, I don‚Äôt really need an education to appreciate the simple, fun fiction I apparently do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: there are a lot of famous classics or mainstream works I can‚Äôt really enjoy too much, or in some cases, at all. And yet, sometimes a random story or webcomic will appear and I just won‚Äôt be able to stop reading. Why? I decided to try making a list of things I like in fiction:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;20 posts so far in my &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34; /&gt;daily streak&lt;/a&gt;, ignoring the time I posted after midnight but including exactly one of this post and the commitment-starting post. You pick which one. The arithmetic works out either way. My last four posts have been made with less than two minutes to spare before midnight, and my last post in particular made it by just seven seconds. This is working as intended in that I‚Äôve knocked out nine drafts that I‚Äôm pretty sure would have rotted in my draft folder for at least a few more months otherwise, and I‚Äôve also jotted down more spontaneous thoughts and posted them instead of postponing them until they was too late to be applicable. But this is also a problem because I can‚Äôt spend every day procrastinating blogging and then frantically blogging before midnight ‚Äî I have some serious programming work to do, and a talk to prepare for, and, of course, linear algebra homework!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm kind of stuck here so&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quixotic Reimagining of Standardized Tests (Part 2)</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/quixotic-2</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2015 23:59:53 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/quixotic-2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you remember, &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/quixotic-1&#34;&gt;Part 1 was here&lt;/a&gt; and my goal is to construct a theoretical system of standardized tests that I would be satisfied by. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve got. As usual, because of the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak I have openly committed to&lt;/a&gt;, standard disclaimers apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôd have a first-tier test like the SAT, except this will be &lt;em&gt;explicitly designed&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to distinguish among the high performers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the test is to assess &lt;em&gt;basic&lt;/em&gt; proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics. Nothing else. Most good students, those who have a shot at ‚Äúgood colleges‚Äù and know it, will be able to ace this test with minimal effort and can spend their time studying for other things or engaging in other pursuits. Students who don‚Äôt will still have to study and it will probably be boring, but the hope is that, especially if you‚Äôre motivated to get into a good college, there won‚Äôt be much of that studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For colleges, the intention of this test is to allow them to require this test score from everybody without having to &lt;a href=&#34;http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-difficulty-with-data&#34;&gt;put up disclaimers&lt;/a&gt; that go like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is really not a difference in our process between someone who scores, say, a 740 on the SAT math, and someone who scores an 800 on the SAT math. So why, as the commentor asks, is there such a difference in the admit rate? &lt;em&gt;Aha! Clearly we DO prefer higher SAT scores!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Well no, we don‚Äôt. What we prefer are things which &lt;em&gt;may coincide&lt;/em&gt; with higher SAT scores‚Ä¶

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Disjointed blog content, posted as part of a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak I have openly committed to&lt;/a&gt;; standard disclaimers apply)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging is weird. I‚Äôm still nervous when I post stuff because I‚Äôm concerned I‚Äôm wrong, and end up looking unprofessional or attracting a bunch of Cueballs or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png&#34; alt=&#34;xkcd&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I told people about this blog, during the time when 100% of its traffic came from its coincidental placement in search results, I didn‚Äôt have to worry about this. Now, I choose my words. Because some Important Person‚Ñ¢ might show up. Maybe even misinterpret something I said and/or get furiously offended at a badly phrased joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also fear that I‚Äôll update my beliefs quickly; maybe I‚Äôll change my mind or discover a much better argument for the other side really soon. But the blog post would still be there, displaying my old belief, giving the reader an inaccurate or misleading impression of myself. People might even chat with me to argue about it, and then I have to &lt;em&gt;admit I‚Äôm wrong oh no!&lt;/em&gt; It feels a lot better admitting I‚Äôm wrong on my own turf, in my own time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passage from &lt;cite&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/cite&gt; comes to mind (I had hurriedly reread the book as ammunition for the AP Literature test and noticed that my past self had marked it):&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is more than slightly intimidating to go into the room through the big sliding door and see everybody dressed up in full-on green surgical garb with masks and hair nets. I don‚Äôt remember this part. Feeling a little vulnerable, I change my clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask to listen to my iPod during the operation ‚Äî I remember being able to do this during the operation four long years ago when the subject of today‚Äôs surgery was inserted into my shoulder ‚Äî but the nurse(?) says it‚Äôs best not to do that because they‚Äôll be using something electric to stop the blood. Instead I can listen to music played from a computer in the operating room. Well, okay then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She escorts me through a bunch of twisty little passages to said room. The computer is a dual-screen Windows XP. The nurse shows me that there is a folder with random albums sorted by year. I poke through the folders and create a playlist in Windows Media Player interleaving &lt;cite&gt;1989&lt;/cite&gt; with a collection of classics from ‰∫îÊúàÂ§©(Mayday). Then I get on the operating table and wait. One of the nurses compliments me on my choice of the latter band. A few tracks later, I deduce that my interleaving had been to no avail because the media player was set to shuffle. I spend a lot of time on the operating table at first not doing anything except stare at the ceiling. There is a white three-legged contraption there, with each hinged limb ending in a large blue-rimmed circle of surgical lights. There are white sans-serif letters inscribed on the rims, saying Chromophare¬Æ E 668 and Berch-something. I think the ‚Äúsomething‚Äù was a synonym for ‚Äúsay‚Äù or ‚Äútell‚Äù. An after-the-fact search says it‚Äôs Berchtold. Typical human memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I am covered with lots of green cloth, which blocks out the ceiling. Instead, I can only see a clipboard and random paper forms on the left side of my peripheral vision, presumably propping up the cloth. The clipboard is a highly translucent pink. The form on top is yellow and has a box saying something about somebody paying; the form on bottom is white with a black-and-pink-striped right border. The clipboard‚Äôs clip also has random streaks of black marker across a white sticker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music plays.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quixotic Reimagining of Standardized Tests (Part 1)</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/quixotic-1</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2015 23:19:42 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/quixotic-1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Life update: I got my driver‚Äôs license from the place where I learned to drive. Then I drove home from there with my mom, and it was zarking &lt;em&gt;terrifying&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, WordPress says it has protected my blog from 3&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; spam comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the morning tomorrow, I have a small surgical operation, so I can‚Äôt sleep too late. (Well, it ended up being pretty late anyway. Darn.) Therefore I think I‚Äôm going to do something unprecedented on this blog for the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak&lt;/a&gt;: I‚Äôm going to post an incomplete non-expository post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the only purpose of the title is to get initials that are four consecutive letters of the alphabet..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more argumentative post sequences on my blog involved ranting against standardized tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My very first stab was probably the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/test&#34;&gt;silly satire&lt;/a&gt; directed at the test everybody has to take that takes up two hours per day of an entire week. Once college became a thing in my life, I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/2400&#34;&gt;humblebrag rant&lt;/a&gt; after I took the SAT and then a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/sat&#34;&gt;summary post&lt;/a&gt; after I snagged this subject for an English class research paper and finished said paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be plenty clear that I am not ranting against this part of the system because it‚Äôs disadvantageous to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it should also be said that I‚Äôve read some convincing arguments for using standardized tests &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; in college admissions (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119321/harvard-ivy-league-should-judge-students-standardized-tests&#34;&gt;Pinker&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2003&#34;&gt;Aaronson&lt;/a&gt;). Despite the imperfections of tests, they argue, the alternatives are likely to be less fair and more easily gamed. The fear that selecting only high test-scorers will yield a class of one-dimensional boring thinkers is unfounded. And the idea that standardized tests ‚Äúreduce a human being to a number‚Äù may be uncomfortable for some, but it makes no sense to prioritize avoiding a vague feeling of discomfort over trusting reliable social science studies. Neither article, you will note, advocates selecting &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of one‚Äôs college admits based on highest score. Just a certain unspecified proportion, one that‚Äôs probably a lot larger than it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although I wish the first article linked its studies, I mostly agree with their arguments. So this puts me in a tricky position. These positions I‚Äôve expressed seem hard to reconcile! So, after arguing about all this with a friend who told me things like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think you fail to understand how anti-intellectual american society is
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(comments on this statement are also welcome) I think some clarifications and updates on how I feel are in order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scary Cars</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/cars</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Part of a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak&lt;/a&gt; but for once I don‚Äôt think I need to apply the disclaimers to this. If you thought for even one second that the title was a palindrome, I‚Äôve succeeded. It‚Äôs not. I don‚Äôt have a good title. Okay, maybe slap the disclaimers onto that part.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I drove a car was on 5/18. I think. I might be off by a day or so. Most of that day‚Äôs lesson was spent learning to go forward and backward, accelerate and decelerate smoothly, and turn the wheel without getting my hands tangled up. My coach made me count out loud how many circles I was turning: ‰∏ÄÂúàÂçäÂúàÂçäÂúà‰∏ÄÂúàetc. It felt kind of stupid when I was doing it, but I guess in the end it helped, and eventually once I got the hang of turning the wheel, I just subvocalized it and my coach also tacitly stopped bothering me about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I activated a turn signal light was probably on 5/26. That was the day I wrote in my TIL log that, when you turn the steering wheel back from the direction you were turning, the turn signal lights turn off automatically. After you think about it, this is a pretty sensible thing for turn signal lights to do, but when I first learned this my mind was utterly blown. Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs like when you‚Äôre turning and you turn on the turn signal and it starts clicking this steady beat to increase the dramatic tension, like you‚Äôre doing a trick in a sports driving game and you have to quickly hit the right sequence of buttons on the controller. Then you actually turn the corner and then turn the wheel back, and as the wheel makes its smooth sliding sound back to its upright position, the beat stops like a resounding V7 to I resolution, as if to congratulate you on executing a beautiful turn without crashing into another car or driving off the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs what it feels like, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On slow days, when you‚Äôre halfway through a turn but the drivers ahead of you are waiting in a queue that stretches on forever on the practice track, you can shift to the parking gear and use the turn signal‚Äôs beat as a metronome and sing along to it too. I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, of course, there‚Äôs the obligatory xkcd:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/turn_signals.png&#34; alt=&#34;xkcd&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs the name of the text file that comes up in MacVim when I hit &lt;kbd&gt;option-shift-Z&lt;/kbd&gt;. I use it for quick notes and editing stuff to later be pasted into webpage forms, especially complicated JavaScripty ones (e.g.¬†Facebook, Twitter) that don‚Äôt play nice with Pentadactyl‚Äôs popout editor functionality. The keyboard shortcut is set in &lt;a href=&#34;http://qsapp.com/&#34;&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/a&gt;, although I was doing something similar even on Windows with AutoHotKey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time I tend to hoard stuff here. Vim says it has more than 40,000 words and 300,000 characters. It contains seeds that never grow into blog posts, planned tweets I later abandon out of embarrassment, preemptively composed comments that never get posted, carefully written text I‚Äôm paranoid might get deleted by the Internet, and more. For today‚Äôs frivolous post (part of a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily post streak&lt;/a&gt;, standard disclaimers apply, etc.), here are some excerpted context-free highlights, like a personal extended game of ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in your Ctrl+V right now?‚Äù. The task of interpretation and/or guessing the context is left up to the reader. Have fun! See you tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Something something something &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak&lt;/a&gt; something something standard disclaimers. My schedule is tighter than usual because IPSC is tonight and runs right up until midnight. Anyway, here‚Äôs my logic with posting this: given how long I‚Äôve committed to posting, I‚Äôm probably going to have to dig deeply enough into my reserves to include it, and to be authentic I can‚Äôt edit the story more anyway, so I might as well do it now. (Also maybe this will pressure me into finishing and posting one of the real short stories in my blog draft folder, the same way I feel pressured to make a good puzzle after posting a bad one.) I‚Äôm not even going to reread my story because I don‚Äôt like cringing at my own writing without being able to edit it, but hopefully that makes it bad enough to be entertaining. If you didn‚Äôt know, this was for an MIT preorientation program application. Tell me if it‚Äôs bad to repost application stuff. I hope not.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Oops this introduction is about as long as the actual story now.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>8 Songs for 18 Years</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/8-songs</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2015 13:40:30 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/8-songs</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At some point I thought, hmm, maybe this blog would benefit from some more sentimental, memory-capturing music/videos, like I chose for my &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/time&#34;&gt;end of 2013 post&lt;/a&gt; or my &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/rewind&#34;&gt;end of 2014 post&lt;/a&gt;. (Yeah, I link to my own posts alarmingly often. I think that‚Äôs kind of weird. I don‚Äôt know.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, because you‚Äôre reading this already, I decided to follow through with that idea. There‚Äôs no particular significance for posting this now ‚Äî it‚Äôs not my birthday or anything, as the title might suggest; it just has a nice ring to it ‚Äî except of course that I‚Äôm starting to get mildly desperate for content for my &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak exercise&lt;/a&gt;. Standard disclaimers apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mostly for my future self. I should note that, although I like these songs, this is not a list of my absolute most favorite songs ever. You can tell because there isn‚Äôt any Coldplay or fun. (the band.) Instead, each of these songs was chosen to be meaningful to myself and my life in at least two different ways that generally don‚Äôt overlap with the other songs. This was difficult but I think I managed it ‚Äî you know, how constraint breeds creativity and everything? Also, they‚Äôre arranged by approximate chronological order of impact. But it also means that this list isn‚Äôt going to be that meaningful to anybody other than myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I have a long list of class-of-2015 sentimental songs, which I‚Äôm not including here because I think there are so many that they deserve a separate post. Will I avoid procrastinating and feeling awkward for long enough to make such a post? Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;shrugs&lt;/em&gt; Whatever, enjoy the music or stop reading now if you want.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two Points on Photography</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/photography</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2015 23:55:52 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/photography</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Uncohesive blog content, posted as part of a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak I have openly committed to&lt;/a&gt;; standard disclaimers apply. Whew, made it by a few minutes‚Ä¶)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essay was partly inspired by but mostly orthogonal in purpose to dzaefn‚Äôs essay on a similar subject, &lt;a href=&#34;https://zyxyvy.wordpress.com/2012/04/09/humans-photographs-and-names/&#34;&gt;Humans, Photographs, and Names&lt;/a&gt;. I agree with many of its points, although I deviate in that I think it‚Äôs more important for my Facebook picture to identify me than to inform about me (there‚Äôs the rest of Facebook, plus my maybe half a dozen other sites, for doing so). Part of the problem for me there, and part of the reason I hang on to my nine-letter random handle from fourth grade, is that my names, first and last, are so commonplace. Among the people who share them (according to DuckDuckGo) are a New York Times tech writer, more than one computer science professor, a photographer, a couple doctors, and some guy who did some sort of graphics work for a short clip and two movies. This means that, to somebody not already in my social circles trying to match me to my account, my Facebook photo is my primary tool for disambiguating myself from all these other people, and I don‚Äôt think there is anything that could do that job quite as precisely as a picture of my actual face and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I agree enough to be bothered by having a profile picture suffering from ‚Äúthe whole extent of photographic informational void‚Äù. I always planned to add some GIMP layers to the photo to indicate context and content more precisely. Except I procrastinated and it got more and more awkward to do this as time went by, since as far as I know, normal people update their profile pictures only to reflect more recent events, especially when they‚Äôre important. Like, you know, &lt;em&gt;graduating from high school&lt;/em&gt;? So yes, I‚Äôve been waiting to do this for an entire year now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eh, to hell with awkwardness. That‚Äôs the spirit of this daily-posting exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Fun fact: The code in what I‚Äôm about to set as my profile picture, if I don‚Äôt procrastinate even more, is real IOI 2014 code I submitted successfully (for &lt;a href=&#34;https://betaveros.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/one-line/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rail&lt;/code&gt;, as previously featured&lt;/a&gt;; the visually selected fragment was the key fix for the final bug I fixed). Except I actually had to manually retype my code printout to get the picture because I lacked the foresight (sound familiar?) to save an electronic copy of my IOI submissions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I‚Äôm glad this isn‚Äôt a smiling photo because I feel like it‚Äôs easier to appreciate happy posts from a person whom one associates with a serious face, than serious posts from a person whom one associates with a happy face, and I want both types of posts to impact people when I post them. I could be overgeneralizing from my own feelings though. If you are reading this and want to chat me feedback (as way more than one of you has been doing), I‚Äôd welcome more data points on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs not what I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to rant about in this post, though.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Short blog content, posted as part of a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak I have openly committed to&lt;/a&gt;; standard disclaimers apply)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the interested, I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ibshgin.wordpress.com/2015/06/17/copyright/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;post summarizing issues in copyright and patent law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on a new blog for a school club. Actually, if you‚Äôre reading this post, you‚Äôre probably already interested enough / bored enough to read that post, so go read it. I think the videos are worth watching despite their length, but I tried to summarize the key points in text, so decide how much to read or watch depending on how much spare time you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know if that blog will work out, but anyway WordPress tells me I have 8500% more followers on this blog than the other one, even though I have doubts about how many of those followers actually read anything I post at all, so I thought I should link to that post here. Also, by publicizing the blog, I get to shame my friends and fellow club members into posting so that it doesn‚Äôt look so empty. Social media expertise, you know?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Thoughts on Teaching</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/thoughts-teaching</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/thoughts-teaching</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Disorganized and probably incomplete blog content, posted as part of a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak I have openly committed to&lt;/a&gt;; standard disclaimers apply)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I‚Äôm actually going to try starting this blog post and posting it in the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story: As a sort of extracurricular activity slash side job, I taught a math class after school once a week to six fifth-graders. It was nominally geared towards some Australian Math Competitions, which my math teacher administers in Taiwan, although in the end I don‚Äôt think I achieved this end very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After writing this brain dump I realized this was a pretty terrible hackjob; I had absolutely no idea how to teach fifth-graders or how to organize an after-school class, and I still mostly don‚Äôt. Parents did most of the organizing, really. And provided refreshments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I get paid for this????&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulleted list of other thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, I didn‚Äôt realize / remember how serious the gender gap between elementary-school students is. I don‚Äôt mean the difference between their performance (that might have been the case, but I don‚Äôt think I felt a significant enough difference to conclude anything); I mean how fifth-grade boys and fifth-grade girls don‚Äôt like to mingle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When given the opportunity, they would pick team names like, ‚Äú[members of my gender] Rule, [members of other gender] Drool!‚Äù They wouldn‚Äôt discuss with each other either. If prompted, they would sometimes point out mistakes in each others‚Äô work, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a phase that people grow out of, and I probably did it myself when I was young. I don‚Äôt remember when it ends, but in any case, ugh, it‚Äôs so unproductive that boys and girls separate themselves for any length of time at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Darn, I only lasted four days. That‚Äôs pretty bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I broke like 90% of my HabitRPG streaks too. I was busy running Monte-Carlo calculations to estimate the number of domino logic puzzles, and forgot about midnight. Okay, before that I spent twice as much time on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www1.flightrising.com/&#34;&gt;Flight Rising&lt;/a&gt; for whatever reason. Bad life decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that means today I have to post one now, before going to sleep, and one later. Eh, time to harvest really weird mini-posts from nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Faux-philosophical blog content, posted as part of a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak I have openly committed to&lt;/a&gt;; standard disclaimers apply)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hard essay to write because (1) it‚Äôs very irrational and I should (and I do) know better ‚Äî death by car accident is much more likely than death by an airplane crash, but the latter is scarier because it‚Äôs more vivid and we have less control over it, and (2) people don‚Äôt like talking about it. When I tried writing it, though, I realized I already burned through most of the down-to-earth worries in the posts I made between April and August of 2010. They still coherently and accurately sum up my current thoughts surprisingly well. And most of the irrational, overly philosophical fears appeared in &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/midnight&#34;&gt;Thoughts at Midnight&lt;/a&gt;. So there used to be a lot of fluff here like this, which was inducing procrastination because I don‚Äôt know what to include and what to cut, but now that I have a daily deadline, I cut most of it. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One, xkcd:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/leaving.png&#34; alt=&#34;xkcd&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two, bonus quote: As really-long-term readers know, I have had a reason to think that I might actually die in the past few years, a real reason that has stayed with me and gotten me thinking now and then about what &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; meaning of life is, instead of a short-lived fuzzy philosophical feeling obtained from reading &lt;cite&gt;Tuesdays with Morrie&lt;/cite&gt; (which is not to say that &lt;cite&gt;Tuesdays with Morrie&lt;/cite&gt; isn‚Äôt a good book; I just suspect no book can convey everything a personal experience can.) Anyway, it‚Äôs over in all likelihood, but the point is that in the middle, I wrote an essay for class in ninth grade, which I find equally coherent and equally representative of my views. The conclusion runs thus:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Frivolous blog content, posted as part of a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak I have openly committed to&lt;/a&gt;; standard disclaimers apply)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of boredom and curiosity, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://betaveros.github.io/bars-college.html&#34;&gt;graphed how many emails colleges sent me&lt;/a&gt;, excluding the colleges I actually applied to. I am being extremely polite and just calling them emails. I‚Äôve wanted to make this for a long time, but it wasn‚Äôt until I saw this &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/message/my-failed-experiment-in-time-travel-3aa2240a6bc0&#34;&gt;post about an email experiment&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://waxy.org/links/&#34;&gt;waxy.org/links&lt;/a&gt; that I understood which tools I could use to quantify my emails. (And then I actually made it and procrastinated posting it here for two months. If you look at my GitHub page or activity you might have seen it already, though. Oops.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt think the results were expected. Other than saying that, I leave the interpretation up to the reader because I‚Äôm on a tight blogging schedule. Cool? Cool.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ninety-nine (card game)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Frivolous blog content, posted as part of a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak I have openly committed to&lt;/a&gt;; standard disclaimers apply)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite interesting that Wikipedia‚Äôs article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-nine_%28addition_card_game%29&#34;&gt;Ninety-nine (addition card game)&lt;/a&gt;, plus many of the following search results (ignoring the identically-named trick-taking game that is guaranteed to show up), have the same basic idea but wildly differing assignment of special cards from the one I‚Äôm familiar with, which everybody I can recall having played with agrees on. (Admittedly I‚Äôve only ever played this among Taiwanese friends.) The only special-card assignment method that came close was a certain person‚Äôs &lt;a href=&#34;https://nmnnmnnmmnnnmnrnmnmnnmn.wordpress.com/2012/09/27/concatenation/&#34;&gt;‚Äústuff from my old blog‚Äù dumping post&lt;/a&gt; I bumped into very accidentally. (His 5 is our 4; our 5 skips to an arbitrary player. The post also clarifies that negative totals bounce back to zero, and includes a clause whereby players must state the running total after playing and lose if they‚Äôre wrong. Interesting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, yes, I am documenting the rules to a card game on this blog. I think this deserves to exist online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rules are not completely rigorous because I don‚Äôt know them completely rigorously. You can use common sense to reach a consensus in corner cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a normal deck of playing cards, or two or more identical decks if you want. Deal five cards to each player and set the rest aside to form a draw pile. Cards are played into a discard pile in the center. Players sit in an approximate circle and take turns along the circle, playing one card and then, usually, drawing one replacement card from the draw pile, so in normal 99, hands stay at five cards. When the draw pile runs out, shuffle the discard pile to become the new draw pile.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Obligatory life update: I have graduated &lt;a href=&#34;https://motivatedgrammar.wordpress.com/2012/01/24/a-brief-history-of-speaking-about-graduation/&#34;&gt;[from]&lt;/a&gt; high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that‚Äôs not what this post is about. I &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/scheduled-blogging&#34;&gt;contemplated setting up a schedule for my blogging&lt;/a&gt; three long years ago, and decided against it, because I didn‚Äôt think writing was a high enough priority for me. Well, I am setting up a schedule now: &lt;strong&gt;I am going to post something on this blog every day&lt;/strong&gt; until I have to leave the country (which is happening once before college, so it‚Äôs not for as long as you think; but I might decide to continue the schedule anyway after I get back. We‚Äôll see when the time comes.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>What do you do when you get a bunch of files like this from a zipfile?
   I‚Äôve blurred the messed-up file names because I‚Äôm not convinced it‚Äôs impossible to reconstruct the Chinese names of people from them and I‚Äôd rather err towards being paranoid about privacy. Except for the one file name whose author‚Äôs identity I‚Äôm OK with disclosing.   Back story: I have been tasked with collecting everybody‚Äôs Chinese assignments for this semester.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/community/c1285h1035830&#34;&gt;original sillier post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note on notation: I‚Äôm going to use &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\text{Stab}(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; instead of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(G_x\)&lt;/span&gt; for the stabilizer subgroup and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\text{Cl}(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; instead of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(^Gx\)&lt;/span&gt; for the conjugacy classes. For the orbit of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; I‚Äôll stick with the norm and use &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Gx\)&lt;/span&gt;, although it‚Äôs only used in confusing summation notation that I‚Äôll explain with words too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We keep using this silly counting argument which I thought was something like Burnside‚Äôs lemma but actually is a lot simpler, just partitioning the set into orbits and slapping the orbit-stabilizer theorem on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(G\)&lt;/span&gt; is the group and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(S\)&lt;/span&gt; is the set then&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Note on notation: to be maximally clear, I have bolded all my vectors and put tiny arrows on them. Normal letters are usually reals, uppercase letters are usually bigger matrices. Also, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\cdot^T\)&lt;/span&gt; denotes the transpose of a matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\vec{\textbf{v}}_1, \ldots, \vec{\textbf{v}}_m\)&lt;/span&gt; be elements of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\mathbb{R}^n\)&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(m \leq n\)&lt;/span&gt;, i.e.¬†column vectors with &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; real elements. Let &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(V = [\vec{\textbf{v}}_1, \ldots, \vec{\textbf{v}}_m]\)&lt;/span&gt;. This means pasting the column vectors together to make an &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(n \times m\)&lt;/span&gt; matrix (&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; rows &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt; columns).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the thing &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\vec{\textbf{v}}_1 \wedge \vec{\textbf{v}}_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge \vec{\textbf{v}}_m\)&lt;/span&gt;, which can be visualized as the hyperparallelogram &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\left\{\sum_{i=1}^{m} t_i\vec{\textbf{v}}_i \,\middle\vert\, t_i \in [0,1], i = 1, 2, \ldots, m \right\}\)&lt;/span&gt; but is apparently a different thing in a different vector space of things. We wonder how to compute &lt;strong&gt;the hyperarea of this hyperparallelogram&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A PSYCHOLOGICAL TIP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you‚Äôre called on to make up your mind,&lt;br /&gt; and you‚Äôre hampered by not having any,&lt;br /&gt; the best way to solve the dilemma, you‚Äôll find,&lt;br /&gt; is simply by spinning a penny.&lt;br /&gt; No ‚Äî not so that chance shall decide the affair&lt;br /&gt; while you‚Äôre passively standing there moping;&lt;br /&gt; but the moment the penny is up in the air,&lt;br /&gt; you suddenly know what you‚Äôre hoping.&lt;/p&gt;
‚Äî Piet Hein
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;By the way&lt;/em&gt;, apparently spinning a penny is a terrible randomization process; studies have shown they &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/gamblers-take-note-the-odds-in-a-coin-flip-arent-quite-5050-145465423/&#34;&gt;come up tails &lt;strong&gt;80%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time.&lt;/a&gt; Tossing or flipping is better but there‚Äôs still a faintly biased &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/diaconis_coinbias.pdf&#34;&gt;51% chance it lands with the same face it started with (PDF link)&lt;/a&gt;. Entirely irrelevantly, is the meter amphibrachic? Nice. I‚Äôm sorry, but the impenetrable English names they give to metrical feet just sound so cool.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As May 1 has been coming up, I‚Äôve been half-seriously giving this advice to others who still haven‚Äôt decided. But I knew this wouldn‚Äôt work for me. I knew where I intuitively wanted to go all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons holding me back were more‚Ä¶ reasonable. Mostly the money. Call it an id-superego conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know if the difference between my choices would mean I‚Äôd have to take out loans, or work a lot during college, or both. I don‚Äôt think either of those things would be difficult. I think tech internships over the summer could just cover the parts assigned to parental contribution (which I‚Äôm not going to let my parents pay, unless they start earning &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; more money than expected) and I think I have the skills to get those internships. But of course that‚Äôs a tradeoff. Maybe there will be something more self-actualizing or more helpful to my future career that I could do during the summer. I‚Äôm not so sure that I‚Äôll find the same drive to program for a job instead of for a personal project I really want to use myself, or for putting off something more boring. I don‚Äôt know yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Get it? Drive? Program? Um, never mind, I guess that‚Äôs a hardware problem.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Puzzle 47 / Fillomino [LITS &#43; Walls]</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CLICKBAIT PERSONALITY TEST THAT YOU CAN DO WITHOUT SOLVING THE PUZZLE: What do you see in the puzzle image below? I have my own thoughts but I won‚Äôt bias you by posting them yet. Sound out your thoughts in the comments below! (I don‚Äôt expect this to work but I‚Äôd love to be proven wrong)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so apparently how puzzles work is I go nearly a year without posting one and then when I post a terrible one, I feel guilty and obligated to post a legitimate one soon after. Testsolved by chaotic_iak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a Fillomino (write a number in every empty cell so that every group of cells with the same number that is connected through its edges has that number of cells) where each tetromino has had their 4s replaced by one of L, I, T, or S describing their shape, and they obey the rules of LITS ‚Äî they can touch if they are not congruent, they must all be connected, and their squares cannot form a 2√ó2 block. In addition, cells separated by a thick border may not contain the same number or letter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

5:27 PM &lt;strong&gt;phenomist&lt;/strong&gt;: do you use gridderface to make pretty puzzles?&lt;br /&gt;
‚Ä¶&lt;br /&gt;
5:52 PM &lt;strong&gt;phenomist&lt;/strong&gt;: actually nvm excel is probably easier lol
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay I‚Äôm sorry this is a horrible puzzle where the rules don‚Äôt make sense and I didn‚Äôt even get it testsolved. I just wanted an image to concisely demonstrate the capabilities of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/betaveros/gridderface&#34;&gt;gridderface&lt;/a&gt;, my puzzle marking and creation program, for the project homepage, after somebody expressed interest in using the program to write a puzzle. Then I got tremendously carried away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thoughts at Midnight</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/midnight</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2015 00:49:18 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/midnight</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are the thoughts that sometimes keep me awake at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are things I don‚Äôt want to think about. These are things I‚Äôve spent hours thinking about, never productively. They are worrying, but unlike typical worries in my life, it is fundamentally impractical to take steps to resolve or mitigate them, after which I may rest assured that I‚Äôve done my best. The reason is that they also happen to be either untestable/unfalsifiable or only testable if one incurs absurd and irreversible costs, mainly dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I explain them away to myself successfully and move on. Sometimes I read what I‚Äôve written and think about these thoughts and do the cognitive equivalent of looking at them funny, as I‚Äôm expecting most readers to feel if they get that far ‚Äî why would anybody be bothered, or afraid, or soul-crushingly panicked about these things? Life is so busy, there are literally more than sixty-four items on my HabitRPG to-do list, and besides, there are so many serious global issues humanity is actually facing right now, and people who are actually deprived of basic rights and resources and have to struggle to stay alive. How can I possibly be bothered by these absurd remote thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I know that other times I do feel those emotions exactly. And if I stare &lt;em&gt;just right&lt;/em&gt;, I can feel those emotions bubbling beneath the surface in me. Sometimes I can‚Äôt explain the issues away to myself, and a deep soul-sucking pang grows in my stomach. I‚Äôm irrational ‚Äî I‚Äôm afraid of some of these thoughts ‚Äî and I have submitted to the fact that there are some edges of my irrationality that would not be worth the effort to fix if just not thinking about them is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes these thoughts make me wish I were not so rational. Sometimes they even make me wish I were religious; it would be easier if (I believed) consciousness were, somehow, special. I suspect if I tried really hard, I could make myself believe something like that sincerely. But I think that‚Äôs a betrayal of myself I‚Äôm not willing to take. I think there are better ways to remain happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to maximize happiness. Thinking about more general moral principles will help with that, but the remoteness of these particular thoughts is such that I doubt I‚Äôll ever have to make a choice that would benefit from me having thought about them. At least, I think the chance is small enough to not be worth the negative utility spent thinking about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: ‚ÄúThere is nothing to fear but fear itself.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I feel frustrated: not thinking about something just doesn‚Äôt seem like a solution. I don‚Äôt know how to come to terms with just how irrational happiness fundamentally is. And I still can‚Äôt resist thinking about them sometimes‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2015 MIT Mystery Hunt</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/hunt</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/hunt</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it‚Äôs been over a week, which is a long time for blog posts to be delayed after the event they‚Äôre documenting in probably all of the world except my blog. So.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this post should start with a bit of background. I‚Äôve been puzzlehunting for‚Ä¶ wow, three and a half years now. I was introduced to puzzlehunts from AoPS, when some fellow members got together a team for &lt;a href=&#34;http://puzzle.cisra.com.au/2011/teamstats_AoPS.html&#34;&gt;CiSRA 2011&lt;/a&gt;, and I think I‚Äôve participated to some degree in every known internet Australian puzzlehunt since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as for my experience with the MIT Mystery Hunt in particular, I sort of hunted with a decidedly uncompetitive AoPS team in 2012 (I think we solved one puzzle exactly), but my serious hunting career began when dzaefn recruited me into the Random team (then Random Thymes) &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/hunter&#34;&gt;for the 2013 hunt&lt;/a&gt; (and I did blog obliquely about it). We didn‚Äôt win (and I actually didn‚Äôt participate that much because I was traveling with family) but the next year (as One Fish Two Fish Random Fish Blue Fish (1f-2f-17f-255f (I am evidently in a parentheses mood today because as you‚Äôve probably noticed, the amount and depth of parentheses in this sentence are positively alarming (lol)))) we won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I do have a half-written post about that which will never get posted (and I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; didn‚Äôt participate that much, because my family was moving that weekend) but okay, let‚Äôs just drop any semblance of chronological coherence on this blog and dump a short version of the list of puzzles and parts towards which I contributed solving, as I wrote them down one year ago:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Okay. So. These things:

These things are a thing. They‚Äôre like mini-trampolines that you are supposed to strap onto your feet and jump around on to have fun, if you‚Äôre, like, six years old, maybe?
Anyway, if you happen to run into a pair of these, please be careful, and please think twice before doing something like, I don‚Äôt know, immediately strapping them on after you see them and jumping as hard as you possibly can, especially not when you are jumping on a hard unforgiving surface, or when you are surrounded by a bunch of impressionable children whom you could be concerned might follow your example or be swayed by your bad influence or something.</description>

      <title>C/C&#43;&#43; to D</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/c-to-d</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm assuming you want to use D largely, but not entirely, for competitive programming. That‚Äôs me right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;basics&#34;&gt;Basics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syntax is very similar. Function definitions, semicolon-terminated statements, variable declarations, and so on. You can declare &lt;code&gt;int main() {...}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;void main() {...}&lt;/code&gt; or something with arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic types like &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; are all there. Wonderfully, &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; is 64 bits. Instead of &lt;code&gt;unsigned&lt;/code&gt; whatever, just prefix a &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;, e.g.¬†&lt;code&gt;uint&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arithmetic operators and bit operators are all there too, including unsigned right shift &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Although &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; is still xor, D has exponentiation as &lt;code&gt;^^&lt;/code&gt;. Sadly, &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; is still same-sign remainder; there‚Äôs no true mod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb1&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode d&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode d&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-1&#34; title=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; std.stdio;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casts look like &lt;code&gt;cast(int) x;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;control-flow&#34;&gt;Control Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;, and even &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; all work as you‚Äôd expect, along with &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; is the nice addition though. Not only can you iterate over arrays and stuff, but range loops go like:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As per &lt;a href=&#34;http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/50_things&#34;&gt;item 3 of 50&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there are better memory-triggering songs but I think this pretty much sums up how I feel about blogging right now (possibly including the very act of choosing that song.) And college apps. And life. Plus, the music video is silly in its own incredible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Around this time a year ago, I made &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/time&#34;&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; talking about how around a year before that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I paused my participation in big high-school competitions, for a variety of reasons.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I rambled on life and programming competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn‚Äôt get it yet, this post so far has been written to meaningfully echo the last one. Nothing so abrupt has happened this year, but I just realized how nice it was to have a paragraph humorously listing the weird stuff I had gotten myself into over the course of 2013, so I‚Äôm going to do so again, even more completely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>College Questions (unprotected ver.)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post, or most of it, was published password-protected once because‚Ä¶ well, I explain that below. (To the one person who actually bothered asking me for the password, just so you know, I did add and rewrite parts. More than a few.) I forgot how distinctly powerful a disincentive a large 2300-word block of text is to the average person, especially when the subject of half of those 2300 words is teenage angst (I‚Äôve already linked to &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/1370/&#34;&gt;xkcd 1370&lt;/a&gt; in enough places so I‚Äôm not even going to embed it here) interweaved with an insufferable amount of rationalist jargon. This will probably filter my readership more than sufficiently already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have still decided to protect one detail of the thought process, though. But even after that, I guess I do care more about how many people read this than I do for most of my other posts, so here‚Äôs a primitive attempt to gauge interest; if you choose anything beyond the first choice, I would also appreciate if you leave a comment, even if you don‚Äôt think you have anything to add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ins datetime=&#34;2017-11-24T18:33:34-0500&#34;&gt;
edit: This poll has been removed, it wasn‚Äôt very interesting anyway.
&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven‚Äôt posted for a long period again, but I don‚Äôt feel too bad about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, until I look carefully at my blog draft folder and remember that I have 90%-finished drafts about the two debate competitions I went to (November 2013 and March 2014), and winning the previous Mystery Hunt (January 2014), and my summer trip to Penghu (July 2013). Which will probably never get posted out of awkwardness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I‚Äôve been busy, completely righteously busy, with college apps to write and algorithm classes to teach and speeches to write and a math club to sort-of lead and all the typical homework besides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then (for those of you who don‚Äôt have me as a friend on Facebook) I got accepted to MIT and Caltech early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for a few days after that, I checked Facebook about sixteen times a day for the Class of 2019 group discussion, except for one day when I really needed not to, thanks to the power of committing to my HabitRPG party to do something. I am increasingly learning that procrastination is something that has to be actively and strategically fought. But that‚Äôs not what this post is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Commemorating Obvious Milestones Involving Chronological Sustenance</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, there had to be something here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have time for anything more complex, so here‚Äôs a low-effort illogical puzzle for the occasion. (It &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; been testsolved, at least. Thanks, Yoshiap.) It also features a brand new category, so as not to distract the people on LMI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don‚Äôt already know what occasion it is, it‚Äôs easy to find out by looking through my archives or possibly anywhere else I‚Äôve left a trail online. Or you could solve the puzzle! (Or you could &lt;ins datetime=&#34;2014-11-20T12:29:52+00:00&#34;&gt;scroll down to read the solution!&lt;/ins&gt;) If this puzzle had an answer, it would be a nine-letter word, although like most of mathematics, it‚Äôs less about the answer than about the path you take to get there‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ins datetime=&#34;2017-11-24T18:36:41-0500&#34;&gt;
2017 edit: A warning that this has somewhat linkrotted and is harder to solve, but theoretically still possible.

      <title>Extreme Value Theorem</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/evt</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/community/c1285h1042959&#34;&gt;original sillier post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‚ÄúExtreme Value Theorem‚Äù, according to my old calculus textbook (Larson, Hostetler, Edwards, 8th ed.), is ‚ÄúA continuous function defined on a closed interval attains a minimum and a maximum on the interval.‚Äù The calculus textbook continues,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although [it] is intuitively plausible, a proof of this theorem is not within the scope of this text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course Rudin proves this, but coming from an unrigorous calculus background, the required deductions span three chapters and are very hard to motivate. That‚Äôs probably because it proves things for extremely general objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, I have no idea why the definition of ‚Äúcompact‚Äù is what it is: ‚Äúa set for which every open cover has a finite subcovering‚Äù. Therefore, here‚Äôs a less general but more motivated proof, from the grounds-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;definitions&#34;&gt;Definitions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real numbers&lt;/strong&gt; are hard to define. We only need to know that we can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and compare them, i.e.¬†they‚Äôre an ordered field, and that they have the &lt;strong&gt;least-upper-bound property&lt;/strong&gt;. That is, if we have a set of real numbers that are bounded above, then the set has a &lt;em&gt;least upper bound&lt;/em&gt;, a bound that ‚Äúperfectly fits‚Äù the set. Precisely, the bound must be such that every element of the set is less than or equal to it, and no smaller value satisfies the same property.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Continuing the porting of stuff from betaveros.stash, and adding more stuff.
Mnemonic Here‚Äôs my mnemonic table for digits, inspired by an old Martin Gardner column. I wrote from memory the first 132 digits of 2012! correctly at IMO 2012 with this table. I had remembered more, but unfortunately, if I recall correctly, I confused myself over whether I had encoded a 5 or a 2 by the S of ‚Äúnose‚Äù, because this is supposed to be more of a phonetic code than a spelling one ‚Äî otherwise double letters would be confusing and lots of randomly appearing digraphs would be wasted, because English is weird.</description>

      <description>Miscellaneous observations that didn‚Äôt make it into a compelling narrative, sometimes because I have forgotten exactly when they happened, sometimes because I only remembered when they happened after blogging about it, sometimes because it just seemed too tangential, sometimes just because of the circumference of the mooooooooooooooooon! (That made no sense and I‚Äôm not going to remember what I‚Äôm alluding to in a few months.)

      <title>[IOI 2014 Part 4] Shades of Xanthous</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No, I didn‚Äôt forget. Not for one minute. I was doing homework. I am very happy because that means I was actually carrying out my priorities as I envisioned them. I‚Äôve probably edited this post too many times, though. Meh. But it‚Äôs the first weekend after finishing summer homework, so here we go again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: This is by far my favorite post title in the entire series. Possibly in the entire history of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning of the last day of official IOI activities, there were a bunch of cultural activities, e.g.¬†writing Chinese characters calligraphically, doing tricks with the diabolo, or picking up beans with chopsticks, and noncultural activities, e.g.¬†getting somebody to pour water into a cup on your head while he or she was blindfolded. Due to the last activity I got wet, but my shirt dried really quickly. And alas, even though I had taken calligraphy summer classes a long time ago, my calligraphy was awful ‚Äî robotic, lifeless strokes without the right aesthetic proportions to make up for it. Blargh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, lunch followed, and then it was time for the closing ceremony, in the same building as the other ceremonies and contests. Our team caught the ending song of in a Chinese musical being rehearsed as we walked into the auditorium. While we waited for everybody, we milled about waving flags that our various teachers had brought, including not only Taiwan‚Äôs flag but also flags of my school, thoughtfully brought by teachers who had volunteered. A little later our leader told us that all the leaders had discussed the matter during a meeting and decided that we shouldn‚Äôt bring any flags to the stage while receiving our medals, so we were going to have to make do with being patriotic and school-respecting off stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few performances, including two aboriginal music performances and the musical we had seen rehearsed ealier, which was a fun rock musical rendition of some Chinese tale that seemed to have been sharply abridged, giving it the plot depth of a Wikipedia stub-article synopsis ‚Äî a conflict, boy-meets-girl-and-falls-in-love, and a lamenting Aesop song conclusion with thrillingly vague general applicability. But the singing and counterpointing and atmosphere were good. I guess it was proportional to the relative importance of the performance to the closing ceremony. The program interleaved them with the long-awaited medal presentations: one round of bronze medalists, one round of silver, one round of gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dum-dum-dum-dum, medals! The home team advantage was really obvious here; the cheering and the medal-presenter handshakes were both significantly more forceful for Taiwan‚Äôs medalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/gold.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/gold.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;I think our leader made this. Thanks.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
I think our leader made this. Thanks.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, after the normal medals had been exhausted, the three full scorers received bags with prizes that may forever remain unknown to my sorry self, as well as a standing ovation from everybody in the auditorium. The orchestra had been going through ABBA songs during the ceremony, and very considerately played ‚ÄúThe Winner Takes It All‚Äù for this part. It was impossible not to mentally fill in the lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The winner takes it all&lt;br /&gt;The loser has to fall&lt;br /&gt;It‚Äôs simple and it‚Äôs plain&lt;br /&gt;Why should I complaiiiiiiiin?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speeches followed. Most were just average forgettable speeches, but Forster gave another speech that was somehow even better than the one he gave at the opening ceremony, with nonstop golden quotables such as:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[IOI 2014 Part 3] Games of Luck and Strategy and Really Weird Noises</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shamelessly getting unfinished business out of the way. Yup, that‚Äôs me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excursion Day 1. We traveled down to Yilan on a bus. I played guess-it with Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
I was quite surprised at myself for remembering this game, but I think it‚Äôs simple and little-known enough to be worth mentioning. Guess-it is a remarkably pure game of luck and bluffing from one of Martin Gardner‚Äôs columns, played with a small odd number of cards, e.g.¬†the 13 cards of one poker suit. The cards are dealt evenly to players (who can look at them) with one card left over, which is kept face down; players take turns choosing one of two actions:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Name a card and ask the other player if he or she has it. These questions must be answered honestly.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Guess the left-over card. The guesser wins if correct; the other player wins if not.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess-it is not trivial because sometimes you should ask the other player if he or she has a card that you already see in your hand; otherwise whenever you answered ‚Äúno‚Äù to a query you‚Äôd immediately guess that the asked card is the hidden one. It is actually a solved game in the sense that the probabilities of the Nash equilibrium strategy for when to guess and when to bluff have been worked out already, but they‚Äôre not simple probabilities by any means and humans are terrible randomizers anyway. A few rounds of it sure beats rock-paper-scissors. I was very amused to lose almost all our games with 11 cards but win almost all of our games with 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, no more gratuitous narrative excursions into game-theory. The first stop, National Center for Traditional Arts, was a very laid-back culture place with old-fashioned retro shops and streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We watched a 3D glove puppetry (Â∏ÉË¢ãÊà≤) video, in the same session as a lot of the leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started trying to sleep at 9 the night before the contest, tossed and turned in bed until 10, then fell asleep and got up at 3:35 in the morning. Blah. At that point, I went to the bathroom and applied some chapstick before trying to go back to sleep until 6. After breakfast, I grabbed a few minutes of sleep on the bus to the convention center where our contest would be, then slept on a sofa outside the actual contest hall alongside most of the rest of our team as we waited for a very long time until it was okay for us to enter. Competitions really mess with one‚Äôs sleep schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, much too soon, we could enter. Day 1 of the contest was about to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laptops were as yesterday, although they were protected with a white screensaver that indicated my name and ID as well as a countdown to the start of the contest. I was glad to see that my mousepad and all my writing utensils had survived without me. Somebody had the sense of humor to project an online stopwatch with an animated bomb fuse onto the screens to indicate the remaining time, which, once again, there was a lot of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I conferred briefly with Paul (TZW (alphaveros (?))) about vim settings for a bit, but there were still fifteen minutes left or so. I idly stretched, practiced typing my &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; on an imaginary keyboard, and watched as the US dude two tables to my left unplugged his laptop‚Äôs mouse and rearranged absolutely everything on his table using the surface under his chair as swap space. (Well, that was how I mentally described it at the time, pending further revelations. (hint hint))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it began.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, I guess it was really na√Øve of me to suppose that I could get any considerable amount of blogging done before the IOI ended. Onward‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left off at the end of the practice session. As if somebody were taking revenge against us for not having to suffer through any airplane trips, we were served a cold airplane meal for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, the box had a sticker that noted its manufacturer as something something Air Kitchen and another translucent sticker that badly covered an inscription saying the same thing in much bigger letters. It contained a cold apple salad, a cold chicken bun, a cold flat plastic cylinder of orange juice, and a package of plastic utensils that was exactly like the utensils that came with every airplane meal ever. I was disappointed, but at least the salad tasted okay, and I ate an extra one because two of my teammates volunteered theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pass the time, we played an extra-evil &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-nine_(addition_card_game)&#34;&gt;ninety-nine&lt;/a&gt; variant. Apparently this is a very Taiwanese game because lots of student guides were teaching their teams the game, although our special cards differ from the ones Wikipedia lists in a lot of ways and our evil variant created more opportunity for sabotage and counter-sabotage and bluffing. 7s are used to draw your replacement card from somebody else‚Äôs hand, and that person cannot draw again and will have one less card; aces are used to swap your entire hand with somebody else, who also cannot draw a card; small-value cards can be combined to form special values (e.g.¬†play a 2 and 5 for the effect of a 7) but after playing a combination you can only draw one replacement card; and later, to speed up the game, we added a rule where all 9s had to be unconditionally discarded without replacement but would still get shuffled back into the draw pile. Players lose if it‚Äôs their turn and they have no playable cards, including no cards at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were playing and repeatedly reveling in everybody ganging up to beat the winner from the last round, an instrumental version of ‚ÄúYou Are My Sunshine‚Äù played on repeat in the background for literally the entire time. It wasn‚Äôt a very good version either. If you didn‚Äôt listen carefully for the fade-out and few seconds of silence at the end of each loop, you‚Äôd think that the loop was only one verse long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[IOI 2014 Part 0] Waiting</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/waiting</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2014 21:30:53 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/waiting</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know day 1 of the contest already ended and is probably a more interesting topic to blog about, but I finished writing this last night just before the internet was cut off to quarantine the contestants from the leaders, who received the problems and began translating them. I didn‚Äôt know about this until it was too late, which is why I‚Äôve been waiting since yesterday to post this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide a counterpoint to the last post, one of the many, &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; advantages of entering an international competition is that you get to meet a lot more people you already know, so there‚Äôs less time spent being socially awkward. While waiting for stuff to happen, aside from all the expected time spent with the Taiwan team, I also talked to, played games with, and otherwise entertained a whole lot of people I already knew, including my schoolmates (no less than fourteen of them were volunteers) and some of the college students who had shepherded us around during olympiad training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is a good thing, too, because there was a lot of waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I waited for my teammates; my parents had decided to take me to the hotel (Fullon Shenkeng) directly, since I had a lot of stuff, and I had arrived early. This took about an hour, after which we had lunch. Then I waited for the hotel to give us our room cards, which took about five hours, after which we had dinner. Finally, at night, I waited for the Codeforces system tests. Very nerve-wracking. But I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantage #2 of being the home team: you can talk to all of the organizers and volunteers fluently, so you can get them to help you more quickly. Although we waited for our room cards for an obscenely long time, I got the volunteers to replace my pinyin-name-card with a legitimate one that said ‚ÄúBrian‚Äù on it really quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, after I talked to a few more people, it looks like they aren‚Äôt going to change my name in the database. So if anybody reading this chances to look at the IOI live ranking and is unable to find me, look for the first name ‚ÄúPo-En‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Indexing debates are boring. Especially when you can just flagrantly disregard all concerns about memory safety (because C++ never had any in the first place) and write &lt;code&gt;int _array[100008], array = _array + 2;&lt;/code&gt; I do this alarmingly often; hence, the title. Hashtag firstworldanarchists. Three ¬± 1 cheers for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.6-latest/html/libraries/array-0.4.0.1/Data-Array.html#v:array&#34;&gt;Haskell arrays&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. One of the disadvantages of entering an international competition as the home team is a lack of time to completely absorb the idea that what is about to happen is a Big Thing. There was lots of time before the other international competitions I went to to spend uncomfortably on airplanes trying to adjust for the timezone difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so for a competition in one‚Äôs own country. Right up to the night before entering the hotel that marks the beginning of everything, I‚Äôm still at home, furiously refreshing the AoPS IMO fora and Facebook for news (!!!), lazily solving trivial Codeforces Div II problems with &lt;del&gt;pointless&lt;/del&gt; point-free Haskell one-liners, and blogging. (There‚Äôs more, but I kind of want it to be a surprise.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let‚Äôs set the rules. Well, there‚Äôs only one, honestly:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Late post. As usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with an online competition ‚Äî write programs, solve problems, get points. I wouldn‚Äôt call the problems easy, but they weren‚Äôt hard either. So I solved all of them. To make it even less impressive, only about twenty people submitted anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the result was just what it was: I ended up with a free ticket to &lt;a href=&#34;https://tw.pycon.org/2014apac/en/&#34;&gt;PyCon APAC 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd prefer a conference about a more functional programming language, but I‚Äôll take what I get. Another adventure!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rise from the Ashes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the first stage of selection camp, I was very nervous because I was fifth place in a selection sequence that would finally result in a team of four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I screwed myself over on the first mock test by committing to a bad implementation method on a problem that was hard to get points on. My method seemed simple, but the memory usage leaked out in a way that was confusing and hard to patch; unfortunately, I tried to patch it in increasingly desperate and convoluted ways rather than scrapping the method, and thus missed out on many of the points elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the second test I failed to read the last problem carefully and spent too much of my time on the second problem, once again missing out on a lot of relatively easy points. I had optimized and optimized and pushed my quadratic runtime down to linearithmic, which would allow me to get the points for the last subtask ‚Äî or so I thought. But with 10 minutes left I had all but one testcase right, and after desperately rereading my code, I realized that I had a string comparison stuck in an inner loop that could make my runtime degenerate to quadratic if the input string had lots of the same digit. In order to have a solidly linearithmic algorithm, I would have to implement a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_array&#34;&gt;suffix array&lt;/a&gt;. Ten minutes? I gave up. (The problem setters told me afterwards that hashing would have worked too; I didn‚Äôt think of that at all. Oops.) I spent the 10 minutes reading the last problem and still failed to read it carefully. So that did not go very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as the title probably gave away, during the third and fourth mock tests everything went much better than expected. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As requested, a puzzle post! Straight from the WTF-variant department. Quite hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/fillomino.html&#34;&gt;Fillomino&lt;/a&gt;, with the additional constraint that for each polyomino, there must &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; exist a path (i.e.¬†a sequence of cells, each orthogonally adjacent to the next) that includes each of the polyomino‚Äôs cells exactly once (and does not include cells outside the polyomino).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a degenerate case, 1-ominoes are banned as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adventures in Cabal Installations</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/cabal</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First Google Code Jam!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format of this competition, allowing us to run programs on our own machines, brought up a very interesting issue for me: what programming language should I be using? (I had had similar considerations for IPSC 2013, but GCJ‚Äôs problems are closer to the traditional ACM-ICPC style.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious choice is C++, the language I use for roughly every other competition, but its safety (or lack thereof) is not very appealing. I need speed, but not &lt;em&gt;that much&lt;/em&gt; speed. Unfortunately I still haven‚Äôt gotten around to learning any other friendlier mid-level languages (on the list: D, Go, or Rust), so I have no close substitutes for C++ right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is certainly available for a reliable arbitrary-length integer type, if nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for non-candidates, Java has &lt;code&gt;BigInteger&lt;/code&gt; and memory safety, but all in all I decided the benefits are too minor and it‚Äôs too ugly without operator overloading. Scala is probably way too slow. So I don‚Äôt expect to be writing either language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only difficult choice I have to make is, of course, Haskell ‚Äî which can be quite fast, even while it‚Äôs ridiculously type-safe and expressive and referentially transparent and easy to reason about, once you‚Äôve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;figured out how to do the problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scrapped step 1 and &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; figured out how to do the problem &lt;em&gt;functionally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gotten the thing to compile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I can handle step 1, step 2 is by no means a simple task, as my struggle to implement a mere &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/haskell&#34;&gt;Sieve of Eratosthenes&lt;/a&gt; efficiently shows. That is fun, but not at all intuitive; I am doubtful I can do this under contest conditions. It is extremely difficult to transfer my skills in learning how to implement, say, a segment tree or treap into this language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But! Google links to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.go-hero.net/jam/10/round/0&#34;&gt;programming language breakdown for 2010 Qualification Round&lt;/a&gt; as an example, and much to my surprise, Haskell ranks somewhere between sixth and tenth place in popularity (depending on what you sort by), so there are functional superprogrammers who can presumably do something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, I ended up implementing all four solutions to the qualification rounds in Haskell, because of the relaxed time limit and lack of any involved algorithms and data structures. I think it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Re-Re-Revisiting the SAT</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/sat</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2014 00:54:03 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/sat</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, I got worked up about the test. Then I got a score and ranted about it on this blog. (I‚Äôm still uncertainly hoping that didn‚Äôt come off as arrogant. Let me add, I did not get a perfect PSAT.) Then a friend pitched to me the idea that I write an article about it for my school newspaper, which I did. It was far too long. As if that weren‚Äôt enough, I then decided to examine whether the SAT was an accurate prediction of ‚Äúacademic ability and success‚Äù for my English research paper. Now I‚Äôve come full circle to this blog, where I‚Äôm going to try to synthesize and conclude everything, free of the shackles of the research paper format, to allow me to move on with my life. This post contains bits lifted from all three essays and lots of new stuff; I‚Äôve been editing it for so long that I feel like I have it memorized. Its word count is around that of the newspaper article &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; the research paper, i.e.¬†far far far too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whatever, nobody reads this blog anyway and I have to get this out of my system. When I said I wanted to ‚Äúmove on with my life‚Äù, I really meant my winter homework. Oops!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; I am not an admissions officer. I have not yet even been accepted to a prestigious university (despite rumors to the contrary‚Ä¶), for whatever definition of ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù, unlike some of the bloggers I‚Äôm referencing. So some of this is pure speculation. On the other hand, some of it is researched and referenced, and I think the pure speculation still makes sense. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm posting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, here we go‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs start with the question of accurate prediction. The SAT is a useful predictor, but not as useful as one might assume. Intuitively, it ought to be more accurate than other metrics because it‚Äôs a &lt;em&gt;standardized&lt;/em&gt; test, whereas GPAs other awards vary by habits of teacher and region and are hard to compare objectively. But as a &lt;a href=&#34;http://research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012/7/researchreport-2008-5-validity-sat-predicting-first-year-college-grade-point-average.pdf&#34;&gt;study from the College Board &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the correlation of HSGPA [high-school GPA] and FYGPA [first-year GPA in college] is 0.36 (Adj. r = 0.54), which is slightly higher than the multiple correlation of the SAT (critical reading, math, and writing combined) with FYGPA (r = 0.35, Adj. r = 0.53).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that doesn‚Äôt mean the SAT is worthless, because combining the SAT score and high school GPA results in a more accurate metric than either one alone. But by ‚Äúmore accurate‚Äù I refer to a marginal improvement of 0.08 correlation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Sands of Time</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Random video! Although I feel that I‚Äôve heard it earlier, my first conscious memory of getting linked to it is from &lt;a href=&#34;http://usamoarchive.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/youre-older-than-youve-ever-been/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. At first I thought it would be the right background music for this post, but upon further reflection I think it mainly suited me while I was writing this post. Well, it‚Äôs topical if you mentally replace ‚Äúday‚Äù with ‚Äúyear‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/q2bo_u_YmW8&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Around this time a year ago, I paused my participation in big high-school competitions, for a variety of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I stopped attempting to make IMO both because I wouldn‚Äôt get that much from the training and because other people ought to have the opportunity. I was concerned that I might condition myself to only be able to do math with the short-term motivation of contests. Better to focus on college math and maybe some original research, I thought. During the year, I did lots of the former and very little of the latter. Meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the IOI, my obvious next target: I was tired of training and going abroad while paranoid about whether my immune system would hold up. I didn‚Äôt feel that the IOI was worth that. To some degree, I also felt burned out about programming. Long story short, my treatment should end soon, and learning Haskell completely resolved the burnout problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most important reason, I think, was that ‚Äúhigh school was too short‚Äù. I started math competitions ridiculously early and didn‚Äôt spend much time exploring other interests. I thought I knew myself well enough that I could say I didn‚Äôt have many more interests at all, but I was completely wrong (psych nerds will reflexively note this to be the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect&#34;&gt;Dunning-Kruger effect&lt;/a&gt;). I coded lots in weird languages ‚Äî Haskell, as mentioned previously, plus Scala, plus all manner of other magical command line tools. I wrote my first math problem and submitted it officially, picked up a new instrument, went to a debate competition, served as an unimportant tech guy for MUN, discovered and became hooked on Pentatonix, participated in three puzzle hunts in Australia and one in Massachusetts, figured out my rough political stance, rode a boat, got retweeted by &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34; data-cites=&#34;eevee&#34;&gt;@eevee&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34; data-cites=&#34;Kyrgyzstan_News&#34;&gt;@Kyrgyzstan_News&lt;/span&gt;, increased my Neopets‚Ñ¢ fortune by over 3400%, and lurked on FurAffinity a little too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, dear competition world, I‚Äôm back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;warning&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; from the future, 2017-11-25: I am fairly unhappy with this rant as it stands ‚Äî it makes many points I still agree with, but it just sounds sooo pretentious ‚Äî but it is one of very few posts to actually receive a link from an external post I‚Äôm aware of, so I am letting it stand for historical interest. I wrote this years ago; please don‚Äôt take it out of context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, I got unhealthily worked up about getting this score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of college, I only ever wanted a score that wouldn‚Äôt be a deal-breaker ‚Äî anything above 2300 would be enough. Any other time I had left would be better spent in other endeavors. Such endeavors might help on the college app, but more importantly, I‚Äôd also get to enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why am I here? Partly it‚Äôs because my classmates got worked up about it. Somebody specifically requested me to post my score somewhere. And partly it‚Äôs because there couldn‚Äôt be a better way at the moment to establish my authority to (yet again) rant against standardized tests here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Edit 11/19 7:23 AM UTC+8: Fixed some transcription errors on right: &lt;strong&gt;R4C17 is D instead of N, and R15C17 is G instead of E.&lt;/strong&gt; Neither change should greatly impact solvability. Thanks to ksun for pointing out an error.
&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logic puzzles are easy to construct if one doesn‚Äôt have some specific pattern or theme in mind. It‚Äôs just that, given the increasing number of constructors and puzzles with amazing themes, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very meaningful for me to just construct more puzzles of the same genres by putting down clues randomly. That‚Äôs why, for my seventeenth birthday, I took the puzzlehunt route and made something without instructions that is not completely solved by logical deduction. Still, I‚Äôve provided all the information needed to do this puzzle initially, so I hope my not getting the inductive bits test-solved can be excused.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI like fantasy books! I used to read a lot of Eoin Colfer.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhat does that mean, &lt;em&gt;used to&lt;/em&gt;? You don‚Äôt read anymore? That‚Äôs so &lt;em&gt;sa-a-a-ad&lt;/em&gt;‚Ä¶‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our teacher and I had this conversation during our first English class, and I realized I agreed with her. Well, no, of course I still read: news articles, r/AskReddit threads, and the books we get assigned in class. But not fiction, almost. As I later mentioned to my teacher, I followed Sam Hughes‚Äô &lt;a href=&#34;http://qntm.org/ra&#34;&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt; avidly (something I highly recommend). That was it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does my present self still think of Eoin Colfer? Although I adored the &lt;i&gt;Artemis Fowl&lt;/i&gt; books when I was younger, my interest faded, but not before I had recommended it to my sister. The conversation spurred me to get out the seventh &lt;i&gt;Artemis Fowl&lt;/i&gt; book, which I had stopped reading halfway through a year ago, and finish it. It was still true that I didn‚Äôt like it as much, because I couldn‚Äôt feel the high stakes strongly in the book and I found that the joking asides compounded the problem. But a few days later, when we took a trip to the Taipei library, I found the eighth book and borrowed it, plowing through nine-tenths of the book before we left. The ending seemed to be happy but still felt counterintuitively poignant for me. In any case, I had closure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what‚Äôs the lesson? Authors vary in output too. I was na√Øve to suppose that because I found this book boring, I had outgrown all books that were even vaguely similar. In the same trip, I also borrowed a bunch of other random fantasy books, plus a realistic fiction book about a teenage pregnancy, just for kicks. It turned out to be surprisingly good. In a week, I read four books, cover to cover, despite a typical load of homework and chemo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any excuses I made before about not having enough time simply don‚Äôt hold water. Still, I have yet to figure out if this sort of reading is sustainable, because not every book is so engrossing. Far from it‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Puzzle 43 / Fillomino [Nonrectangular &#43; Walls]</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/puzzle-43</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/puzzle-43</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm extremely satisfied ‚Äî a little incredulous, in fact ‚Äî with how this puzzle came out. &lt;a href=&#34;https://chaosatthesky.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;chaotic_iak&lt;/a&gt; labels it the ‚Äúmost ridiculous fillomino ever in history‚Äù. Apparently, it‚Äôs rather tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ins datetime=&#34;2013-09-30T13:05:57+00:00&#34;&gt;
ETA: Journalistic responsibility compels me to mention that chaotic_iak also added, ‚Äúmight be beaten later‚Äù. Oops?
&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/fillomino.html&#34;&gt;Fillomino&lt;/a&gt; combining the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mathgrant.blogspot.tw/2011/09/monday-mutant-95-polyominous-no.html&#34;&gt;Nonrectangular&lt;/a&gt; (polyominoes can‚Äôt be rectangles) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://mathgrant.blogspot.tw/2012/10/fillomino-fillia-2-preview-series-walls.html&#34;&gt;Walls&lt;/a&gt; (polyominoes can‚Äôt span thick lines) variant rules. I think the first variant first came from mathgrant; I‚Äôm not as sure about the second, but they both appeared in &lt;a href=&#34;http://logicmastersindia.com/forum/forums/thread-view.asp?tid=525&amp;amp;posts=64&amp;amp;start=1&#34;&gt;Fillomino-Fillia 2&lt;/a&gt;, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a number in every empty cell so that every group of cells with the same number that is connected through its edges is a shape that‚Äôs not a rectangle with that number of cells. In addition, cells separated by a thick border may not contain the same number.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I couldn‚Äôt remember how long it had been since we entered the ninth floor. Somebody had covered the elevator area with cartoon animals and landscapes. Not surprising, since all the children‚Äôs wards were here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny idea, that: I am still a child for medical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not sick. Not more than usually, anyway. I didn‚Äôt need to get an IV drip installed or even change into the patient uniform the first night. There was nothing to do or feel. No guilt or fear, unlike last time ‚Äî this check-up had been scheduled for along time and served as a simple test to see how my bone marrow was doing. No annoyance, either, because I knew it mattered; but no apprehension of the results, or of the needles. You can never get used to the needles, but you learn to just accept them anyway. There is nothing to be done about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows? The result could be something bad. But I know enough not to take this hypothetical seriously before it was anything other than hypothetical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slept, and dreamt of vomiting carrots.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/fillomino.html&#34;&gt;Fillomino&lt;/a&gt; puzzle. Inequality signs in the grid must be satisfied by the two numbers they touch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Funny, I go on a trip to Penghu followed by a four-day science camp and also get dragged into drawing classes and some sort of movie advising joint, and this is what I decide to blog about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it‚Äôs summer, I went back to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rankk.org/&#34;&gt;Rankk&lt;/a&gt; and solved stuff. This is lots of fun if you‚Äôre good with computers, plus a little math, cryptography, and general puzzling. I‚Äôm still stuck on level 8‚Ä¶ oh well. Since the levels didn‚Äôt seem very indicative of difficulty to me, I decided to do some analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New challenges have been added to Rankk over time, so my metric of difficulty is the number of solvers divided by the time from release to now. Of course this is far from perfect; for example, a challenge‚Äôs author doesn‚Äôt always seem consistently counted as a solver, problems with lower numbers and problems that will help level up are more likely to get checked out by new rankkers, and so on. But this is just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Isn‚Äôt it weird to suddenly talk about this topic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt think that I have ever talked about music any more than briefly in passing. It might be confusing to my &lt;em&gt;finger quotes&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;audience&lt;/em&gt;, and I worry I‚Äôll seem inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. If you wonder, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know that you sang and played the piano, or you liked music in that way ‚Äî or, at all‚Ä¶‚Äù please note that I didn‚Äôt know either.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Parts of this (a majority of questions, I hope) are intended as satire. Other parts of this are silliness created to blow off steam from being coerced into spending nine unproductive hours. Still other parts exist simply because I wanted to have equally many questions per test. Also, 256th post w00t. &lt;ins datetime=&#34;2019-08-22T22:21:48-0400&#34;&gt;(2019 edit: after the migration, this post count is wildly incorrect, but whatever.)&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Haskell and Primes</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/haskell</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
‚ÄúI have been told that any encryption becomes safer if the underlying algorithm is maximally obscured, what is most conveniently done by coding it in Haskell.‚Äù ‚Äì rankk
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional programming is terribly addicting! Partly I think the completely different way of thinking makes it feel like learning programming, and falling in love with it, all over again. Partly there‚Äôs this evil sense of satisfaction from using &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;s (and later &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;$&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code&gt;=&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;s) to improve readability for initiated Haskellers and worsen it for everybody else. Partly it‚Äôs because &lt;a href=&#34;http://learnyouahaskell.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is such a fun read ‚Äî there are too many funny bits to list but my favorite so far is when the author analyzes the first verse of Avril Lavigne‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;Girlfriend&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I think my code in Haskell tends to be more readable than in other languages, code obfuscation in Haskell is almost natural: all you have to do is refactor the wrong function to be ‚Äúpointfree‚Äù, which means that even though it‚Äôs a function that takes arguments, you define it without parameters by manipulating and joining a bunch of other functions. Example (plus a few other tiny obfuscations):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb1&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-1&#34; title=&#34;1&#34;&gt;isPrime &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; liftA2 (&lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;) (liftA2 (&lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;) (&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; ((&lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;) (&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;/=&lt;/span&gt;)) &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;rem&lt;/span&gt;) (&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;flip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-2&#34; title=&#34;2&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;takeWhile&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;] &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;flip&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; liftA2 (&lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt;))) ((&lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QQ wordpress why no Haskell highlighting &lt;ins&gt;(Editor‚Äôs note from 2017: The migration should highlight this now!)&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for some reason, you can do this in Haskell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb2&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb2-1&#34; title=&#34;1&#34;&gt;ghci&lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb2-2&#34; title=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(via &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yellosoft.us/evilgenius/&#34;&gt;Haskell for the Evil Genius&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, but seriously now. I wrote this about my journey to learn functional programming in the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/programming&#34;&gt;programming babble post&lt;/a&gt; half a year ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The main obstacle I have is that it‚Äôs hard to optimize or get asymptotics when computation is expensive (a big problem if you‚Äôre trying to learn through Project Euler problems, particularly ones with lots of primes).

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/informatix.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/informatix.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;Informatix [MUMS Puzzle Hunt 2013]&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I somehow managed to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~mums/puzzlehunt/teamstats.html?team=not+AoPS&#34;&gt;get 25 points all by myself&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~mums/puzzlehunt/&#34;&gt;MUMS Puzzle Hunt 2013&lt;/a&gt;. Well, I pestered chaotic_iak a little with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~mums/puzzlehunt/2013/puzzles/3.3_Diagnosus_ghQ3AcbJ.html&#34;&gt;3.3 Diagnosus (.html with animated .gif)&lt;/a&gt; but we still didn‚Äôt recognize all the Pok√©mon until hint 3, at which point Google sufficed for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nowhere near the top, but compared to the usual results of whatever AoPS team I form, it‚Äôs amazing. By far the best result of AoPS was on CiSRA in 2010 (46th with 58 points), before I discovered puzzle hunts in AoPS; unfortunately due to people getting older and the influx of younger and younger people to the fora, there are less possible teammates each year and they have less time, so here I am by myself. (Also I could have accepted an invitation from a guy in the some-form-of-Elephant team, but I figure if you can win two MUMS hunts in a row you don‚Äôt need any more people.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all: Yay!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This is beautiful. Why do they have to make it sound all mysterious and difficult? That‚Äôs (the reciprocal of) the golden ratio, by the way.

Transcript since the resolution is far from awesome: ‚ÄúMost angiosperms have alternate phyllotaxy, with leaves arranged in an ascending spiral around the stem, each successive leaf emerging 137.5¬∞ from the site of the previous one. Why 137.5¬∞? Mathematical analyses suggest that this angle minimizes shading of the lower leaves by those above.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and there‚Äôs this. chaotic_iak rejected this variant for his &lt;a href=&#34;https://chaosatthesky.wordpress.com/puzzles/#fff&#34;&gt;February sequence&lt;/a&gt; in order to get consistent 7x7 dimensions, so I made one. It‚Äôs been about a month. I have no idea why I procrastinated posting it until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a Samurai &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/fillomino.html&#34;&gt;Fillomino&lt;/a&gt;, which means each grid satisfies the constraints on its own. Write a number in every empty cell so that, in each square grid, every group of cells with the same number that is connected through its edges has that number of cells. Note that the two grids must contain the same numbers where they overlap, but the grouping should be considered independently. I‚Äôd explain this really carefully if it weren‚Äôt the main gimmick of this puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yay crazy hybrids! I guess this one is kind of hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw a loop through adjacent vertices that cannot intersect itself. For each pair of symmetrically placed numbers, one is a Slitherlink clue which indicates how many of the four edges around it are drawn, and one is a Contact clue which indicates the total length of all straight segments adjacent to it where segment length is always measured up to the nearest turns in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adventures in Scala Pseudo-Abuse</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/scala</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2013 22:01:25 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/scala</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, what have I been doing with programming recently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scala-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing multiparadigm programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and interoperates with Java. I learned about it last time reading random articles on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say ‚Äúamazing‚Äù I mean ‚ÄúThis is a language in which my code gives me nerdgasms every time I read it.‚Äù Wheeee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, it‚Äôs not perfect. People say it‚Äôs too academic. It has a notoriously complicated type system (which is &lt;a href=&#34;http://scientopia.org/blogs/goodmath/2013/01/21/types-gone-wild-ski-at-compile-time/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turing-Complete&lt;/em&gt; at compile time&lt;/a&gt;). Its documentation is a bit patchy too. For a serious introduction, the Scala website has plenty of links under documentation, and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scala-lang.org/node/104&#34;&gt;tour of features&lt;/a&gt;. Somebody wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour&#34;&gt;another tour&lt;/a&gt; that explains things a bit more. So here, instead of introducing it seriously, I‚Äôm just going to screw with its features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example of freedom. Scala lets names consist of symbols, and treats one-parameter methods and infix operators exactly the same. The full tokenization rules are a bit detailed and I put them at the bottom of this post for the interested. This lets you create classes with arithmetic and domain-specific languages easily, but it also creates some silly opportunities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb1&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode scala&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode scala&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-1&#34; title=&#34;1&#34;&gt;scala&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; * = &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-2&#34; title=&#34;2&#34;&gt;*: Int = &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-3&#34; title=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-4&#34; title=&#34;4&#34;&gt;scala&amp;gt; * * * * *&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-5&#34; title=&#34;5&#34;&gt;res0: Int = &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;1728&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Yay?
Right now I feel about this a lot like I felt about getting Twitter. Nobody I know personally is there, but all the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù ‚Äútechnological‚Äù people are, and something like 90% of the open-source projects I bump into are too.
Just like Twitter, I barely know how to use Git either, but that‚Äôs okay. For version control I‚Äôm going all command-line now! Last time I tried to link stuff up with Eclipse everything exploded, but after I ran git init from the terminal this time, it‚Äôs highlighting things red and green everywhere like it‚Äôs suddenly begging me not to forsake it for the command line.</description>

      <title>Pronunciation Stereotypes and the Uncrackable IPA Code</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/pronunciation</link>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;warning&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I wrote this in 2013. It seems too irreverent in places when I look back, and not quite in the way that I‚Äôd like, but maybe it‚Äôs kind of amusing anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; just because a significant number of people in group A (esp.¬†of a certain race/ethnicity) also have quality B does not mean that (i) all or most people of group A have quality B or (ii) people of group A who do not have quality B are in any way strange or inferior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, stereotypes are stupid; don‚Äôt apply them to real people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stereotypical ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù (a person from ‚ÄúAsia‚Äù, a mythical faraway continent consisting of two countries, China and Japan) is too hard-working, gets disowned for any grade below an A, has infinitesimally thin eyeslits, and pronounces L‚Äôs and R‚Äôs identically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/BtNBg.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/BtNBg.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Animation: A door labeled Supplies opens to reveal four Asians in martial arts robes with stereotypical insignias mouthing the words &#39;Surprise!&#34; title=&#34;Supplies!&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;jumps at opportunity to find and use .gif seen on Reddit without understanding any context&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet says the L/R thing is mostly due to Japanese having only a single sound somewhere in between those two. Wikipedia has a page on Japanese phonology which seems to support this. Still, Wikipedia articles on phonology all consist of giving every sound a long incomprehensible name, such as the ‚Äúapical postalveolar flap undefined for laterality‚Äù for the Japanese sound discussed above, and I‚Äôm not Japanese, so don‚Äôt take my word for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandarin Chinese (blatantly ignoring the myriad dialect variations) has a perfect L sound („Ñå) and an R sound („Ññ) that is only a little different. Of course, there are people who still pronounce them identically, but it‚Äôs not common ‚Äî generally, the language teaches L‚Äôs and R‚Äôs well. Right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Draw a loop through vertices that cannot intersect itself; each number indicates how many of the four edges around it are drawn; the loop must pass through all large dots, and it must go straight through white dots while turning either before or after (or both), while it must turn on black dots without turning either before or after.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So winter vacation started and parents had planned a trip to southern Taiwan, to get closer to nature and walk around and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the MIT Mystery Hunt, the absolute granddaddy of all the other puzzlehunts in terms of age, structure, and size, happened this weekend. Originally, I didn‚Äôt have a team and just planned to look at the puzzles after they got archived and &lt;s&gt;try solving some puzzles&lt;/s&gt; read the solutions while constantly thinking, ‚ÄúHow could anybody ever solve that?‚Äù Because of that, I wasn‚Äôt planning to even bring my laptop at first; then I could force myself to study some long-overdue ring theory during the nights. I was taken aback by a private message on Saturday morning from somebody with many different names inviting me to remote-solve for Random Thymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: !!!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a sentiment randomly appears in my brain. I wonder about it. There‚Äôs a draft I‚Äôve worked on because I‚Äôm trying to get something out of my bubble. My emotions are confusing and they need to be released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after a few sentences, they‚Äôve been released, but the post‚Äôs not out there because I want to polish it. First it‚Äôs just a look-over for typoes or grammar, then maybe I want to get the flow of the sentences right or cut down the embarrassing bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on the third read-over, I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm writing it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is another &lt;a href=&#34;https://mellowmelon.wordpress.com/double-back/&#34;&gt;MellowMelon‚Äôs Double Back&lt;/a&gt;. Briefly, draw a closed loop through all square centers visiting each bold-outlined area twice. Shaded cells do not influence solving, only aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs mostly easy, I think. It‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt know what the theme means. (Yes, chao, I want more contrib points.) Also, WordPress seems to have stopped automatically linking images to their files. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been a while, hasn‚Äôt it? This is something I constructed semi-experimentally to stop failing at an entire genre of puzzles, and then procrastinated posting just about forever. I only test-solved this on paper; I hope I didn‚Äôt do anything silly while digitizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules paraphrased from USPC because I can‚Äôt find any good links: Write each of the given words into its own snail; letters must be entered from the outside of the snail spirally inward. Not all squares will be used; squares with ‚Äú-‚Äù must stay blank. Each letter can appear at most once in each row and column.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ridiculously Long-Winded Programming Babble</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay I don‚Äôt actually know how this pointless rambling got so long. I know the longer it is the more people will just tend to skim, because I do that all the time. So I went back and refactored‚Äîer, rewrote all the somewhat tangential bits (wow these puns are too easy) into footnotes. Manually. Obviously if I have to do this again I‚Äôll write a script for it. But the post is still really long, and I bet nobody will read the whole thing. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life updates: I got out of the hospital Friday two-and-a-half weeks ago, went to the preliminaries of NPSC (a national team programming contest) with classmates, threw up a lot, went back into the hospital, and came out again. I wrote a lot of stuff about the experience and how much it sucked (hint: &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;) when I started this draft around that time, but now putting so much detail in this post feels weird. I‚Äôm mostly good now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years ago NPSC was the only programming contest I really knew of; now I‚Äôve participated in quite a few more, both online and locally, but it‚Äôs still the only contest I‚Äôve entered that gives you real-time verdicts. I believe it inherits this from being modeled after ACM-ICPC, but that‚Äôs for college people and I‚Äôm less clear on how it works. All the other contests, namely &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.topcoder.com/&#34;&gt;TopCoder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeforces.com/&#34;&gt;CodeForces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://usaco.org/&#34;&gt;USACO&lt;/a&gt;, and the other local individual competition (there doesn‚Äôt appear to be an English name so for the purpose of this post I‚Äôll just call it ‚ÄúNameless Local‚Äù; there‚Äôs a nation-wide competition in one-and-a-half weeks!), have system tests after the contest that don‚Äôt allow you to resubmit afterwards.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; They all give pretests that you get to know about right away, just to catch super-silly non-algorithmic mistakes like failing to remove the debug statements or reading input from the wrong place, but these contain weak test cases and don‚Äôt guarantee that the solution will pass the system tests and get full score.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Okay, I give up. Here it is: Gridderface is a (quoting the project description, which I wrote anyway so whatever) ‚Äúkeyboard inferface for marking grid-based puzzles in Java‚Äù that I‚Äôve been working on for too long. It is open-source under the GPL v3.
Basically, it‚Äôs a thing you can paste logic puzzle images into to solve them in, like people do in Paint, when you can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to print them.</description>

(Ahahaha puzzle 33 on 11/22‚Ä¶ I wish it was intentional :P)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw a path through square centers which enters and exits through the given places. Outside the ‚Äúice barns‚Äù (the gray things), the path may turn freely but may not self-intersect; inside ‚Äúice barns‚Äù the path may self-intersect but may not turn. Each ice barn (not necessarily every cell but every region, I think) must be passed over. The path must pass through each given arrow in the given direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, a ‚Äúbig‚Äù crazy mutant puzzle for a ‚Äúmilestone‚Äù &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/1000/&#34;&gt;(as seen on xkcd)&lt;/a&gt;, both for this blog and for my life. Things are rough now, but I prepared this ridiculously ahead of time. It‚Äôs still not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; big, but I‚Äôm not so experienced and I don‚Äôt have the inspiration for something like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=535&amp;amp;t=506208&#34;&gt;an entire mini-puzzlehunt&lt;/a&gt;. Also, I think I should attempt more word-bank-based puzzles some day so I won‚Äôt fail as completely at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway: This is a Slitherlink combining MellowMelon‚Äôs &lt;a href=&#34;https://mellowmelon.wordpress.com/slitherlink/crosslink/&#34;&gt;Crosslink&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mellowmelon.wordpress.com/category/puzzle-types/slitherlink/liar-slitherlink/&#34;&gt;Liar&lt;/a&gt; variations. Draw a loop through vertices that can intersect itself but must go straight both times if it does; each number normally indicates how many of the four edges around it are draw, but exactly one clue in each row and column is false. Have fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/fillomino.html&#34;&gt;Fillomino&lt;/a&gt; puzzle where every polyomino is required to be an L-shape, as in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/sashigane.html&#34;&gt;Sashigane&lt;/a&gt;. Write a number in every empty cell so that every group of cells with the same number that is connected through its edges is an L-shape (with arms of positive length and 1-cell thickness) with that number of cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second, and now symmetric, attempt at this crazy self-invented mutant; &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/puzzle-22&#34;&gt;puzzle 22&lt;/a&gt; was the first. A word of warning: I can‚Äôt solve this without bifurcating near the end, so logic purists may be disappointed, but I like the clue arrangement too much. In fact I suspect this puzzle could have many more clues removed without affecting uniqueness, so tight are the rule constraints in this type.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Haha, way-overdue &lt;a href=&#34;http://logicmastersindia.com/FF2/&#34;&gt;Fillomino-Fillia&lt;/a&gt; practice puzzle. This is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/fillomino.html&#34;&gt;Fillomino&lt;/a&gt; puzzle; in addition to normal rules, treat numbers inside the grid as building heights. Numbers outside the grid indicate how many buildings can be seen from that direction, where a building blocks all buildings of lower or equal height behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: I should warn that the arithmetic here is pretty annoying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay did I mention how I sucked at the command line? This is part of the journey towards stopping. Yes, I‚Äôm on a Mac and it‚Äôs not very *nix-y in some ways but it‚Äôs enough for me for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today‚Äôs story starts when I learned about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the pure-command-line GNU Debugger, which is incredibly cool. I have tried and failed to learn how to use the debug function on many of my IDEs; I found shotgunning &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; statements as needed faster. This may well be the first time I found a command-line tool so much more intuitive than the GUI-equipped programs. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I learned that for some reason the &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt; on this computer was 6.3, which is 1.2~1.5 major versions behind (depending on how you count) and missing a frustrating amount of features. (The one that the current Code::Blocks installer installs is also something like 6.4. Blech.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Unread Count</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;warning&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; from 2019: My 2012 self wrote this. I don‚Äôt remember writing it. This is the first time I have felt personally attacked by a post I wrote seven years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do so many people have these three- or four- or even five-digit inbox unread counts? I become uncomfortable when I have more than about five unread emails, or if there are twenty emails of whatever status in my inbox ‚Äî the rest get archived, of course. Out of sight, out of mind. Whew. It‚Äôs hard for me to fathom how anybody can sleep knowing they have such a scary number of unread emails waiting for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does the status of being unread matter, one might ask? There are already so many ways to classify things in the typical inbox: stars or labels or folders or flags or whatever your mail service may call them. Well, the thing that makes the unread qualifier stand out is that it already has meaning; you don‚Äôt need to assign it any. It means you haven‚Äôt read it! Thank you, Captain Obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know how to use email, there are no good reasons to ignore the status. Is the email actually not important to the point where you won‚Äôt even bother to read it? In that case, why is it even in your inbox? If it‚Äôs spam, mark it as such; spam filters are pretty effective nowadays, but only if you train them, and even if not it only takes one click to get rid of it. If it‚Äôs some notification you don‚Äôt care about, unsuscribe or fine-tune your subscription. As invasive as web services are getting nowadays, I haven‚Äôt yet seen a legitimate one that doesn‚Äôt provide a link to let you do one of these things, even if it‚Äôs concealed in small gray text at the bottom of the email. Should you encounter a notification that doesn‚Äôt have these links or doesn‚Äôt stop spawning evil clones after you tell it to, don‚Äôt think twice; it is spam and should be mercilessly filtered as such. And if you still have two hundred emails left after all that, you should either rethink your values or start reading them now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/fillomino.html&#34;&gt;Fillomino&lt;/a&gt; puzzle where every polyomino is required to be nonrectangular (which also bans squares). Write a number in every empty cell so that every group of cells with the same number that is connected through its edges is a shape that‚Äôs not a rectangle with that number of cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://logicmastersindia.com/FF2/&#34;&gt;Fillomino-Fillia 2&lt;/a&gt; is coming! Anyway I don‚Äôt know how to judge difficulty but this is probably terrible practice. I should try a Skyscrapers if I can keep pretending USH homework doesn‚Äôt exist which I probably shouldn‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In fact I tried to be too tricky and spent a very long time fixing an ambiguity. It was worth it though.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Matrix Intuition</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/matrix</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Oct 2012 17:01:29 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/matrix</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stopped by a friend‚Äôs house a few days ago to do homework, which somehow devolved into me analyzing what programming language I should try to learn next in a corner, which is completely irrelevant to the rest of this post. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in normal-math-curriculum-land, my classmates are now learning about matrices. How to add them, how to multiply them, how to calculate the determinant and stuff. Being a nice person, and feeling somewhat guilty for my grade stability despite the number of study hours I siphoned off to puzzles and the like, I was eager to help confront the monster. Said classmate basically asked me what they were for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, what a hard question. But of course given the curriculum it‚Äôs the only interesting problem I think could be asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was hurrying through the high-school curriculum I remember having to learn the same thing and not having any idea what the heck was happening. Matrices appeared in that section as a messy, burdensome way to solve equations and never again, at least not in an interesting enough way to make me remember. I don‚Äôt have my precalc textbook, but a supplementary precalc book completely confirms my impressions and ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù doesn‚Äôt even appear in my calculus textbook index. They virtually failed to show up in olympiad training too. I learned that Po-Shen Loh knew how to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.cmu.edu/~ploh/docs/math/mop2009/alg-comb.pdf&#34;&gt;kill a bunch of combinatorics problems with them (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, but not in the slightest how to do that myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere else, during what I‚Äôm guessing was random independent exploration, I happened upon the signed-permutation-rule (a.k.a. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_determinants&#34;&gt;Leibniz formula&lt;/a&gt;) for evaluating determinants, which made a lot more sense for me and looked more beautiful and symmetric&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\det(A) = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \text{sgn}(\sigma) \prod_{i=1}^n A_{i,\sigma_i}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I was annoyed when both of my linear algebra textbooks defined it first with cofactor expansion. Even though they quickly proved you could expand along any row or column, and one also followed up with the permutation formula a few sections later, it still felt uglier to me. Yes, it‚Äôs impossible to understand that equation without knowledge of permutations and their signs, but I‚Äôm very much a permutations kind of guy. Sue me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;You can interpret this as me about reaching level 8.1 (the user ranking) on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rankk.org/&#34;&gt;rankk&lt;/a&gt; or complaining about how infuriating level 8.1 (the puzzle) is. I‚Äôm torn.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;warning&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: My 2012 self wrote this. It is a little dated and does not entirely capture my current beliefs and attitudes, although I have to say it‚Äôs not too far off either. As of 2018, &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/me-and-facebook&#34;&gt;Me and Facebook&lt;/a&gt; is more relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/orange-comment.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/orange-comment.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;orange-comment&#34; width=&#34;458&#34; height=&#34;85&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1383&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Here‚Äôs a guilty secret: I like getting feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not restricting myself to painstakingly thoughtful comments that attempt to &lt;em&gt;build upon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;transform&lt;/em&gt; the post to form an interesting conversation, the kind English teachers are hellbent on promoting. Sure, I get the most kicks out of those, but I‚Äôm not picky. Even single-digit pageview bars or a handful of Facebook ‚Äúlike‚Äùs give me buzzes of excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a guilty feeling, because I also think that that these are unimaginably cheap internet currencies and should not qualify as ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù under a rational mindset. I strongly suspect visitors accidentally click on my blog and leave after five seconds without taking in anything, because I do that all the time to other people‚Äôs blogs and sites. Sometimes it is out of boredom, sometimes it is because I actually have something of higher priority to do than indiscriminate reading, sometimes it is simply because I cannot read the language. I‚Äôve seen plenty of people like posts on Facebook based on the poster, only occasionally taking into consideration the first word of the post in question, before actually reading them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the proliferation of ‚Äúliking‚Äù on Facebook bothers me. I don‚Äôt expect everybody to reply meaningfully to everything when they just want to express approval lightly. However, when I see that tiny minority of people handing them out to people in their own threads like programs at a concert, I become indignant. Under their influence, what was originally a straightforward, meaningful badge of appreciation becomes a handwavy gesture that carries virtually no weight, and then I don‚Äôt know what to do when I see something I like &lt;em&gt;seriously&lt;/em&gt;. Will clicking that button still express the feeling strongly enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I accept that, in our stressful world, a few instant effortless gags that take ten seconds to fully process and approve deserve a place. Nevertheless, the number of people who seem to want to make the ‚Äúlike‚Äù a completely passive and automatic action is almost physically painful:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/fillomino.html&#34;&gt;Fillomino&lt;/a&gt; puzzle where every polyomino is required to be an L-shape, as in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/sashigane.html&#34;&gt;Sashigane&lt;/a&gt;. Write a number in every empty cell so that every group of cells with the same number that is connected through its edges is an L-shape (with arms of positive length and 1-cell thickness) with that number of cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May be slightly reminiscent of &lt;a href=&#34;http://mathgrant.blogspot.com/2011/09/monday-mutant-95-polyominous-no.html&#34;&gt;no-rectangle Fillominoes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Slightly‚Ä¶&lt;/em&gt; (Has anybody done this before?

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;warning&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: My 2012 self wrote this. It‚Äôs a bit dated, but it‚Äôs okay, and also is of historical interest for featuring me explaining the CSS I learned from English class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I notice that I have hoarded a large number of strange assignments and essays from another school year of work I get all guilty. First there‚Äôs the knowledge about ancient Chinese dynasties and plant hormones that I only have shadows of recollections of, which makes me wonder whether all the time and effort invested by teachers, classmates, and myself have gone wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, though, that given that I still sense these shadows, it shouldn‚Äôt be difficult to look up and relearn this stuff if I ever need to do so. This brings me to the non-factual parts of the learning, such as writing skills with all its variations. There‚Äôs persuasive writing, which I don‚Äôt use much because I can‚Äôt usually even persuade myself to take a side in anything, let alone others. There‚Äôs descriptive writing mode, which I don‚Äôt use much because the most vividly describable things I encounter are food, and the shallowness of piling flowery adjectives together to talk about food just makes me cringe nowadays. Previously, I wrote at least two such compositions in sixth grade. Blech.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

[edit: okay guys I‚Äôm surprised at many people come here with search queries looking for solutions. If you want IMO solutions, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewforum.php?f=834&#34;&gt;the corresponding AoPS forum&lt;/a&gt; invariably has many of them. This is probably late-ish, but just in case.]
&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 of the contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that in Chinese [or Mandarin, whatever] ‚Äúfour‚Äù is unlucky because it‚Äôs a homophone for ‚Äúdeath‚Äù, and hospitals tend to skip it in floors or ward numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that there was going to be an anecdote involving the seventh Artemis Fowl book but I couldn‚Äôt make it work so instead you have a weird and utterly disconnected metareference to something deleted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know, it sounded cool at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 4.&lt;/strong&gt; Find all functions f: Z ‚Üí Z such that, for all integers a,b,c that satisfy a+b+c = 0, the following equality holds: &lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[f(a)^2+f(b)^2+f(c)^2=2f(a)f(b)+2f(b)f(c)+2f(c)f(a).\]&lt;/span&gt; (Here Z denotes the set of integers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An innocent-looking functional equation, but once you start trying it you discover that there‚Äôs quite some depth to it. Random guessing can yield that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(f(x) = x^2\)&lt;/span&gt; is a solution, so I proved inductively that after dividing out a constant f(1) then the remaining part of f is a perfect square. Letting &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(f(x) = f(1)g(x)^2\)&lt;/span&gt; with g(x) a nonnegative integer and factorizing the original equation, I got an auxiliary functional equation equivalent to the original equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casework on small values of g, and the surprises started coming hard and fast. First: wow there‚Äôs an extra odd-even solution! Then: woah there‚Äôs another mod 4 solution! What is this madness?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have just realized that I have only ever tried one level of difficulty in puzzle construction, viz., ‚Äúas hard as I can make it‚Äù.

      <title>[IMO 2012 Part 4] The Inequality of Broken Dreams</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/inequality</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I could spend all day coming up with post titles like this one. Really, I could. Anyway, after receiving the letter gently reminding me to turn in the official IMO report in Chinese, I finished that first and turned it in. This, plus the fact that I don‚Äôt have any way to do any of my summer homework yet, should make continued blogging much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These months of preparation and anticipation, and in just over two days it will be behind us forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus were my thoughts at 3:30 in the morning, which were a much worse method of preparation than that which I used for the APMO, which involved trying for the first time to put my compass in its box and staring at a cryptic crossword. Twisted thoughts as I lay innocently in bed, trying to preserve my spirit and mathematical function. I got up at 6:30 and ate a breakfast nervously with the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dispersed into the contest hall. Flat squarish white tables in orderly rows greeted us. They were considerably smaller than the arm-span tables we had last year in the Netherlands‚Äô stadium, but the space was still ample compared to the ones we took our practice tests on at home. I floundered a bit looking for whoever was supposed to check our stuff for forbidden items, but none of the proctors paid any attention to that, so I flipped through my own jacket pockets paranoidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But preparation was too brief, and there were at least fifteen minutes left with nothing to do except try not to panic. I managed to fill these fifteen minutes by doing elaborate breathing exercises, raising and flapping my arms, counting down seconds, focusing on a color word, meditating badly, clearing out everything nonmathematical from my mind with a symbolic gesture. This is not a very coherent description, but I wasn‚Äôt feeling very coherent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened an eye halfway and watched as the clock ticked down the last few seconds. The starting signal sounded. I opened up the problem envelope‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who knew coming up with strangely cryptic and illogical but nice-sounding post titles was so much fun!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this break in storytelling is mainly brought to you by generic summer laziness, as well as possibly a tiny bit of chemotherapy adverse effect. There is only a little perfectionism involved, and that‚Äôs because this post contains a long awkward situation (you might have guessed already). I guess this is what it feels like to have oodles of stuff to blog about, but not enough motivation. Heck, these few days with running the TAIMC have long filled my list of rant topics with juicy stories until it‚Äôs near-bursting. But I need to end this self-pity party before I get carried away, so‚Ä¶ back to the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stranded in a foreign country at least 20 degrees Celsius below our comfort zone, having worn the same clothes for 36 hours of airplane travel, and still with less than 48 hours until the contest and &lt;em&gt;zero out of six compasses&lt;/em&gt;, we were running out of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick inventory of clothes showed that, after including the vests and caps in the backpacks we got, we probably had just enough clothes to survive the cruel frigid environment. So, reluctantly, we left the games room and hit the street to hunt down some underwear and socks to change into. Not to mention toothbrushes and some T-shirts and jackets for good measure, because the inside of the hotel was not the right temperature for full cold-resistance gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some haphazard wandering up and down the streets later, we found a store that suited our needs and picked up some clothes. The underwear came in two sizes: too loose and too tight. We picked the latter. Oh well, it would only be for a day or so‚Ä¶ right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[IMO 2012 Part 2] The Hotel of Deception</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/hotel</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Jul 2012 12:45:41 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/hotel</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived at the hotel at 3:30, meeting another local from Taiwan, Mr.¬†Chen, who helped us carry some of our stuff off the bus. Po-Chiang, our guide, was waiting inside. We took more pictures and finally lugged the meager stuff we had off to our hotel rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, we tried. I started to realize that there was much more to this hotel than it seemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, of course, was the confusing placement of rooms with numbers starting with 4 and 5 on the fourth floor (which would be the fifth floor by our numbering system, where the lobby is floor 1; but here the lobby was assigned 0. Off-by-one errors just waiting to happen here.) Secondly were the completely indecipherable signs. I don‚Äôt remember the details, but the first signs we saw read something like ‚Äú560 ~ 540: left; 520 ~ 540: right‚Äù. Occasionally there would be weird slashes or half-slashes between the numbers instead (later I finally realized they were slanted, Comic-Sans-style capital Ys, or ‚Äúand‚Äù in Spanish). Are these closed, open, or half-open intervals? And why the heck are their upper and lower bounds in a different order!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wandered through the corridors, peeking down each one, trying to figure out whether the numbers were increasing or decreasing and whether a parity argument (for those of you not fluent in math lingo, that means odds and evens) allowed for the existence of our room. Who knew the simple act of finding one‚Äôs living quarters could be so mathematically tasking? In the end, our rooms were in the last corridor, just about diametrically opposite to the elevators on the half of our floor. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room was pretty nice overall. The furniture and basic facilities were quite complete, with a sparkly bathroom and a couple tables and chairs of various shapes. The closet was big and had a safe, which was rather important because just about everybody we had met had warned us over and over again about all the incredibly skilled thieves, muggers, and pickpockets in Argentina. It was probably much safer (no pun intended) in the hotel, but with all of these warnings (later we would even find a notice from the hotel warning us to lock our doors) I was never entirely certain. There were lots of lights controlled by a set of confusing switches on either side of our beds. There was at least one white immovable divider cunningly disguised as a switch, one switch that didn‚Äôt ever seem to do anything, and one that turned everything off. The last one made a little sense after a while because it had pictures of stars and a moon on it, but the whole setup was still pretty non-user-friendly in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/metal-chopsticks</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs time to begin the epic blogging journey. The detailed version of this year‚Äôs amazing IMO, because I decided that a perfectionist guy like myself could not possibly liveblog and be satisfied with both the quality of the posts and being able to fully enjoy the actual event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our story begins in a hotel in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night before departure, us six contestants and Prof.¬†Lin gathered in a hotel. This was entirely necessary because our flight left at something like five o‚Äôclock in the morning. After checking over the flight plans and relevant phone numbers in a conference room, we enjoyed a pretty extensive buffet dinner, what would easily be the best meal we would get to have for at least a week, the highlight of which was a fish steak that looked and tasted exactly like fried egg. Afterwards we did some emergency shopping and prepared a convenience-store breakfast for consumption three o‚Äôclock the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I‚Äôve complained before, we have an 11-hour difference to get used to, and that morning I had gotten myself to sleep as late as 6 AM trying (successfully, much to my amazement) to complete an iPod OS system update. I didn‚Äôt think I could pass airport security with the sort of consciousness I had when I finally slept that morning, so I reverted with the rest of the team to an 11 PM curfew. Oh well. The seven of us left the hotel after 3 AM, setting off in a huge 30-person bus for the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luggage drop-off was mostly uneventful. I realized that the airline didn‚Äôt seem to like passengers bringing two bags onto the airplane, and decided to distribute my bag with all the winter clothes in it into my luggage and my backpack. Little did we know what would happen to the luggage‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Glowstick Memories</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/glowstick</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/glowstick</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So. It looks like I‚Äôve officially graduated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to wonder whether it really means anything. Taiwan‚Äôs system classifies the grades neatly into 6/3/3 sections, but then our bilingual department also uses the somewhat illogical and faintly sexist freshman-sophomore-junior-senior naming thing, in which the big jump happened last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of these naming issues, of course, really matter. Shakespeare says, ‚ÄúA rose by any other name would smell as sweet.‚Äù Nor, I would think, do the different color of uniforms we have to wear (pink, if you didn‚Äôt know.) But AP classes probably count for something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to take AP Biology. Why did I pick AP Biology anyway? It seemed like a reasonable default choice. I guess I would like to know something more about the mysteries of life and consciousness to guide my philosophical side, and many of the other courses looked too murderously intense. The perfect stepping stones into the giant hamster wheel of overachievement that everybody is crazy about here. But then I learned I still received eight chapters to study by myself during summer vacation, alongside the English reading assignment. Oh well, so much for relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, I used to think of this issue, about all the academic work we students pile onto ourselves and all the ensuing stress and chaos, from a strange detached third-person viewpoint. Not everybody has a mind that is fit for all that brainwork. Some people have to do the artistic, imaginative things. Some people cannot function optimally in our intense learning environment. Somehow, imperceptibly, according to my apparently not-all-that-bad grades, I put myself in the crazy book-grinding category, and I am having second thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt feel the energy for all this intense future yet‚Ä¶ The past is still so close, so vivid, so attractive. Our graduation trip, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, okay, fine, I admit it, what follows is a rough record of our graduation trip that has been stuck in draft limbo for approximately forever, and I was trying to segue into it. I‚Äôm a perfectionist, what can I say?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wait, are you serious? Under two weeks left, is that what it‚Äôs come to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened to my majestic plans to go over every functional equation I failed on, ever? Or to go through a super-intense geometry-immersion period and actually try to develop some of that crazy ‚Äúintuition‚Äù thing? And I have &lt;em&gt;finals&lt;/em&gt; coming up too! I just finished a ludicrous deadline-extended geography project that I am absolutely confident is the crappiest paper of my entire school career so far! And despite a semester of (slacking) classes, my Spanish is still only barely at a usable level! Exclamation marks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt panic‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs focus on the positive. I am absolutely prepared with my stationery. I bought three spanking new 0.4mm pens that say ‚ÄúCan write for 1000 meters!‚Äù because all of my current ones are annoyingly thick and constantly having almost-but-not-quite run out, plus three new mechanical pencils and enough matching 2B lead to last me through college. All the pencils and lead are Pentel. I haven‚Äôt done any research, so if something terrible happens in Argentina I know what company to blame, and I am writing it here so I won‚Äôt confuse the brands. Also, in view of what happened to SCH‚Äôs carry-on baggage last year (luckily there was no geo on Day 1), I got an extra compass I hope won‚Äôt be needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we‚Äôre listing all the &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; I have gotten ready:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/twitter-bandwagon</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;warning&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: My 2012 self wrote this. It is preserved for historical interest and amusement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha look at all the services&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ahem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you‚Äôve been hiding under a rock for the last decade, Twitter is a platform for microblogging, i.e.¬†blogging with very short posts, called tweets, which have to be under 140 characters after they shorten all the links for you for no reason, often after you‚Äôve already shortened it once somehow-or-other. And yes, I hopped onto the bandwagon during procrastination. Everybody who matters on the technological edges of the internet seems to have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not arrogant enough to imagine I could compare Twitter to anything else authoritatively‚Ä¶ I only barely count myself as using it. But a brief set of first impressions should be okay. Twitter is very public: you can see everybody‚Äôs tweets, who everybody is following, and who everybody is being followed by; the single privacy setting is a simple binary choice to lock up your account, so that everybody who wants to see what you posted needs your explicit authorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Facebook feed consists of entries such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;photographs of people I barely recognize, which I scroll past quickly‚Ä¶ unless my mom comes up and says ‚ÄúWho is that?‚Äù and spends ten minutes looking at more such photos while asking me questions like ‚ÄúHow do you go to the next picture?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy is this photo so blurry?‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;context-less fragments of some larger conversation, e.g.¬†‚ÄúLOL!‚Äù or ‚Äúlinglinglinggg‚Äù (copied verbatim from a status)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alerts of J. Random Person having taken a Personality Test or scored too many lines in Tetris&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta-Facebook infographics, like a cloud of your closest friends or number of status posts. I tend to‚Ä¶ have an extraordinarily negative impression of the type of narcissistic achievement-reliant‚Ä¶ &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;‚Ä¶ who need rewards at every step, except that they seem to be &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt;‚Ä¶ *sigh&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, it‚Äôs official now. I‚Äôm on the 2012 International Mathematical Olympiad team bound for Argentina, and if I didn‚Äôt make a post about this I would be ashamed to call myself a blogger. So, a little moment of smug self-satisfaction should be justified, I hope? And not to mention, last year‚Äôs title of youngest Taiwan contestant is not yet passed? Let‚Äôs cue the evil laughter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/toot.png&#34; alt=&#34;Obligatory xkcd where a guy pops up and toots a literal air horn&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶or maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a simple tabulation of our selection problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&#34;1&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GA/GN/CG/GNC/NGA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AG/CA/NG/GCN/AGA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GA/GN/CA/GCN/AGC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algebra x9, Combinatorics x7, Geometry x12, Number Theory x8. In other words a distribution in perfect negative correlation with my estimated ability in each subject. At least, that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve always estimated them before about a month ago. Ouch, the last stage was the only one of the three where problem distribution for combinatorics actually reached its fair share. (Alternative interpretation: 2011‚Äôs distribution was majorly f123ed up with only one real geometry problem, which just means that this year‚Äôs battle will probably be difficult for me. (Alternative alternative interpretation: the evil, nasty, wicked, depraved windmill was actually an outrageous negative for me. Gee, I don‚Äôt know how to feel. But I should actually do stuff instead of wildly speculating; let‚Äôs get back to the topic.))&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some bloggers have a regular schedule for posting and forcing themselves to meet the deadlines. In essence, something like ‚Äúupdates every Thursday.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I think this is a bad idea, because it forces me to write. If my day is boring and uneventful as it quite often is and I still have to crank out a post, it would not be a post that readers would enjoy. Better once-a-month enthusiastic, interesting posts then an ugly stream of tedious drudgery for the visitor to wade through every time, stuff like (quoting one random ancient post):&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally getting into geography honors. And surviving, somehow, with grades that still might count as ridiculous-in-a-good-way. The one big change I‚Äôm getting used to is the need to take actual hardcore &lt;em&gt;notes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For eight years, most classes I‚Äôve gone to, both inside or outside school, have been straight from a book or handout, which would be so easily read and comprehended (‚Ä¶to me) that any notes would be a waste of energy. A couple science teachers would make us take notes and count them as a grade. All you had to do to get an A was write down most of the important bits, even if the chapter sections were written in exaggerated cursive that took up half the page and there were random teddy bears straddling the margins, as in my notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a stage in maybe seventh grade where I told myself I would make neat, doodle-free notes that actually summarized the stuff in biology (the easy seventh-grade kind (not that we still remember all of it)), and to get to that goal I would force myself to use only one page for each section, with a special way to mark the vocabulary words. It helped studying a little, but the stage didn‚Äôt last, and I ended up doodling again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when the going finally got tough and understanding became a nontrivial task, I still had irrelevant embellishments and a bunch of artificial fonts for my ‚Äúnotes‚Äù. Even in the days when I was free to go to the Chiao-Tung University for classes twice a week (and still get consistently ridiculous grades, judging by the score breakdowns the prof gave us after every test), my notes looked like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this, then our APMO testing time is over! There‚Äôs a small chance of me being really happy or really frustrated about how I did, but I‚Äôm betting on a solid ‚Äúmeh.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A ratio-preserving enlargement of the janko.at sample invocation puzzle, perhaps. I wanted to try using smaller clues. Finally a grid too large for full-size displaying! Is that even supposed to be an achievement?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;warning&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I wrote this in 2012. Maybe it‚Äôs kind of amusing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, everybody around here seems to think that adding English characters, no matter how broken or meaningless, confers an added sense of quality or superiority. I don‚Äôt really understand the mindset here but it‚Äôs the only explanation I can come up with. It‚Äôs certainly not to make the lives of our English-speaking population any easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were sharing songs in Chinese class with literary techniques, and there were a bunch of songs, including mine, by this pretty famous singer with the stage name &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_Leong&#34;&gt;Fish Leong&lt;/a&gt;. Okay, it‚Äôs kind of cute and it‚Äôs a translated homophonic Cantonese pun, so it makes some sense, although I wonder what people would think the name meant if mentioned without any context. There was this more obscure guy a couple seasons back in the reality TV singing competition (see, no original shows around here) whose name was Quack. &lt;em&gt;smacks head&lt;/em&gt; It‚Äôs also kind of cute if you only know that the word is the sound a duck makes, which probably holds for most of the audience. But still, it takes just five seconds to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quack&#34;&gt;put it into Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. Oops?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs 2/22 and I have low standards.

This is a normal Slitherlink, except all the 2s have been given to you. Thus, empty squares cannot have exactly two edges around them. Of course it‚Äôs been done before (guess who?)
I appear to be drastically overshooting a monthly schedule :P</description>

      <description>Not actually my first try, but I guess I don‚Äôt need to resort to 6x6s to fill up my quota just yet, do I?

Okay for the absolutely uninformed, this is a Fillomino (or see MellowMelon‚Äôs rule page).
I‚Äôve switched to 32x32 pixel cells because they seem a reasonable size and it‚Äôs possible to express all pixel sizes as an exact floating-point fraction of the cell side so my image generator can be used in a general way to get perfect stroke thicknesses without worrying about any rounding errors no matter how obviously numerically insignificant they would be in this case.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: My 2012 self wrote this. It is preserved for historical interest and amusement, and does not reflect my current beliefs or attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laptop I‚Äôm typing this on is over two years old. This is not a lot by some measures, but weird spontaneous glitches are starting to accumulate to the point where they‚Äôre getting on my nerves. The internet card still needs an extra reset to start working half the time, and occasionally warrants a full reboot, which costs five minutes. The USB ports are loopy, some windows just show up black when they feel like it, and there‚Äôs a steadily climbing whir in the background. I‚Äôm kind of anticipating the moment the whole thing just drops dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I‚Äôm not about to run out of computers to use (there‚Äôs a noisy XP desktop that also barely works despite handling all our print jobs, but also one spanking new eight-core CPU laptop, which Dad considered a valuable enough investment (?)) but such a loss is still not something to be dismissed lightly. And the externalized cost is far more important and chilling. Who knows how many kids in the Congo had to mine coltan, or how much conflict has occurred over the crude oil, or what awful conditions those sweatshop-assembly workers are going through? Annie Leonard‚Äôs words still resonate with me from when we were first shown the video a year ago. Which is more recent than this laptop, so that doesn‚Äôt mean that much. I think a couple months ago I would have absolutely no second thoughts about getting a new one, though. Yup, I‚Äôm in a quandary (ha ha vocabulary) on the balance between desensitization and compulsive hoarding of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, as triggered by my confrontation with the Chinese book report (remember? whatever the answer is, it‚Äôs okay): a reflection on my incompetence at dealing with two languages, and why this matters, or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can think in both languages. It‚Äôs a natural product of our school environment. The two languages often have to complement each other; most of the nerdy terms or globally relevant allusions are English-exclusive (I couldn‚Äôt talk coherently about SOPA in any language other than English!), but a lot of cultural and geographical staples around here are Chinese only. And sometimes there are unexpected holes where an innocuous-looking phrase simply has a few too many connotations to translate perfectly (the example I always get stuck on, and have yet to solve satisfactorily with anything short of a full sentence recasting, is ‚Äúappreciate‚Äù.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>There are two big elementary and middle school competitions around this part of the globe. Well, ‚Äúbig‚Äù according to ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard of it‚Äù, which is by no means an accurate measure of, well, anything. I don‚Äôt go out of my way to look for them any more, even though‚Ä¶ hold on, am I still eligible? Whatever.

&lt;p&gt;So obviously this isn‚Äôt a good parody and the song is ancient (under some ‚Äúpop‚Äù definition, which is probably not a very discriminative label), at over four years. Just randomness that finds its way onto my iPod. And the words are not very creative, and there are even two lines that survive unscathed because they fit reasonably and I can‚Äôt think of anything better (and I don‚Äôt even know if this is supposed to be bad, I just want to ensure nobody expects otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;

 Two months ago for some random reason I noticed that somebody had found this blog by Googling for the Freedom Writers contest page. Shortly thereafter, the school went ahead and held it for the second time, two years after the first contest, and even more people have started searching for some combination of ‚Äúibsh freedom writers‚Äù, resulting in an anomalously large number of hits to a certain just-over-two-years-old post.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new year. A new start. And just a chance to abuse the phrase ‚ÄúSee you next year!‚Äù It‚Äôs hard to get tired of using it once every 365.24 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I have decided to open up my other blog to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons for not doing so previously. Firstly, there‚Äôs a lot of silly writing with unexplained LOLs and exclamations all over the place in the archives, not to mention the countless other sorts of weirdness linked to the handle I‚Äôm using here that‚Äôs spread over the rest of the interwebz. But I like to keep old stuff as some kind of record that my past self existed, and I‚Äôve given up being embarrassed about them. And anyway, now and then I‚Äôm still performing embarrassing acts that outstrips any of this stuff by miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was thirteen*, the world was a different place to me. I imagined thousands of creepy people staring at computer screens out there, waiting to kidnap children and sell them to clients halfway across the globe the instant they figured out their addresses and statuses as minors. I don‚Äôt blame that old me; there has been at least one computer class devoted to videos of this type.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. I was hoping I could blog for once without predictably explaining something about how this doesn‚Äôt mean anything about future posts or activity or anything, but apparently I can‚Äôt get started without a lame start like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight months have passed since I started my fight with leukemia. Yes it has been a rough eight months, full of unpredictable pain, nausea, diet restrictions, and freakishly-sized needles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been waiting for I don‚Äôt know how long for everything to go back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, but now that I look back I can no longer imagine the idea. The world, outside, still seems to be rushing at its insane pace towards maximum chaos. Economic and natural crises still seem to be always around the corner. But in here, in the hospital ward, or at home, it‚Äôs a really different feeling. I feel completely disconnected. Nothing changes; every day is waiting, waiting, waiting for the future, for a better moment or feeling or achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what, really?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: This post is backdated. I am writing this post in 2018 because, as part of the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/remigration&#34;&gt;Big 2017 Remigration&lt;/a&gt;, I have decided to delete most of the posts because they were too embarrassing and sparse on information, but figured I might keep a rundown of the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow my cousin deleted the Eragon game from his PSP. Ah well, it was fun while it lasted. Current project: get that secretary-problem paper done. It looks much nicer now, due to the references and big bold titles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Now and then I find myself lapsing into a bunch of 42-related questions. The most recent occurrence was the day before yesterday, and I decided that the meaning of life is to find your meaning of life. Since that would tautologically entail that I had already completed my meaning of life, I decided to reject it, even though it has a pretty nice ring to it. Some goals:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have just come back from a week of continuous mathematics, board gaming, and hitting people with sticks to ensure that they get up in time. Yippee! Those problems sure do get around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm reconsidering. It‚Äôs not that boring. LOLZ. There it goes again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particulars‚Ä¶ well, I got to play my cousin‚Äôs PSP. It was an instant like the instant when I saw the Krusty Kreme shop during our visit to Indonesia (shoot, my mouth is watering again), I found a very interesting game logo. A shining blue lowercase E. Most people would think of the Internet Explorer logo. But obviously, Microsoft is probably not affiliated with Nintendo or whatever company made PSPs; even then you can‚Äôt play Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have a life and I still don‚Äôt know what to do with it. I like making powerpoints, programming, typing tests, made-up hyperbolic IQ tests, Gmail, and odd things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that animation has gone to my nerves. And Bookworm Adventures pining. Best word so far: VORACIOUS, which earned me a blue gem tile, which froze somebody. I want to design games for PopCap too, because then I get to play the ones they already have for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got to sit and vegetate on a bus for a total of four hours. My MP4 was already getting boring. In fact the time spent at the math lesson was less than that. Luckily the bus home had a TV that kind of worked, and showed a replay of the show that self-translates as ‚ÄúOne Million Star‚Äù. I only watched a bit. The rest was highly tumultuous slumber. Dinner was spaghetti, which helped.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Biking is fun. Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt require as much exertion as other workout methods do. The thing you learn most from it is how to obey traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;‚ÄúI asked him if he knew what the word ‚Äòobey‚Äô meant. He replied,‚ÄùSure. It‚Äôs a place online where you can buy stuff.&#34;&#34;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got persuaded by my mom to seriously use the LearnToSpeak Spanish CD we bought. I say ‚ÄúHasta luego‚Äù into the mic and it says I selected ‚ÄúEstoy bien‚Äù. Still, the vocabulary it selects are far better than the ones I selected haphazardly. ¬øQu√© quiere decir ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù? Well, I‚Äôm stopping the finding of new vocabulary in Spanish madly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I lost my Kitchen Midden rubric by clipping it into the questionnaires. I wasn‚Äôt sure until I found it there. I flipped through the questionnaires and found it in ten seconds. Wooooo! WHAT ARE THE ODDS? Luck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hooray! Something I ate today cured my cold! Well, they assuaged it for today at least. Perhaps by dinner I‚Äôll be coughing like a donkey with terminal asthma again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, enough with horrible similes. Luckily or not, in P.E. class we didn‚Äôt do the lethal 100m dash timing. Instead we practiced jumping. Hooray! It‚Äôs not as exerting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;After submitting my article onto my Magnum Opuses website section I got to drink some more pearl milk tea that wasn‚Äôt sweet at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was little I used to look at everybody drinking bitter things like tea, coffee, beer, wine, and all that. I simply couldn‚Äôt imagine growing up and liking them. Everything good at that time was sweet, sugary, sweet, and unhealthy. Then I realized that I hated candy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent excercise: I‚Äôve bicycled all over the place, almost going into Jhubei. Obviously, with parental notice. In fact they rode with me. Or, more strictly speaking I rode with them.

&lt;p&gt;I have been pondering an interesting problem for a long time. Which virtue is the best, the most important, the most worthy of epitomizing the word ‚Äúvirtue‚Äù? Due to homework constraints I have been unable to put this up for a long time, which is frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My candidates: First, honesty. Then we have kindness. Then responsibility, and optimism, and courage, and intelligence. It doesn‚Äôt look like a fair match, really.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Humans depend on electricity. It‚Äôs the main problem with blackouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prehistoric people didn‚Äôt have this dependency. If our world is further electronized, blackouts will be very dangerous and will have to be made more robust.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brucelindbloom.com/&#34;&gt;Bruce Lindbloom&lt;/a&gt; has a ton of equations, but I just want the big ones on one page. We‚Äôll assume &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB&#34;&gt;sRGB&lt;/a&gt;, which implies using &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminant_D65&#34;&gt;D65&lt;/a&gt; as white (if you‚Äôre using Bruce Lindbloom‚Äôs calculator to check your implementation, make sure to set these).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rgb-linear-rgb&#34;&gt;RGB ‚Üî Linear RGB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\Xi\)&lt;/span&gt; (one of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(G\)&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(B\)&lt;/span&gt;) be an RGB component in the range &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\([0, 1]\)&lt;/span&gt;. (This is an obnoxious variable choice, but I‚Äôm trying to not overload any variable names in this entire post.) If you have RGB values in &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\([0, 255]\)&lt;/span&gt;, divide them by 255. It can be converted to/from the &lt;strong&gt;linearized component&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\xi\)&lt;/span&gt; (one of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(g\)&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(b\)&lt;/span&gt;) as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\xi = \begin{cases} \Xi/12.92 &amp;amp; \text{if }\Xi \leq 0.04045 \\ ((\Xi + 0.055)/1.055)^{2.4} &amp;amp; \text{if }\Xi &amp;gt; 0.04045 \end{cases}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\Xi = \begin{cases} 12.92\xi &amp;amp; \text{if }\xi \leq 0.0031308 \\ 1.055v^{1/2.4} - 0.055 &amp;amp; \text{if }\xi &amp;gt; 0.0031308 \end{cases}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called ‚Äúcompanding‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you can use &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\xi = \Xi^{2.4}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\Xi = \xi^{1/2.4}\)&lt;/span&gt; in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;linear-rgb-xyz&#34;&gt;Linear RGB ‚Üî XYZ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convert between XYZ and linearized RGB. Again, this assumes sRGB and D65.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align*}
X &amp;amp;= 0.4124564r + 0.3575761g + 0.1804375b \\
Y &amp;amp;= 0.2126729r + 0.7151522g + 0.0721750b \\
Z &amp;amp;= 0.0193339r + 0.1191920g + 0.9503041b
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Coq Reference</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/ref/coq</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/ref/coq</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems like a rite of passage to create one of these because there are so many Coq tactic cheat sheets out there and there‚Äôs just so much to learn. Here‚Äôs mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mostly about tactics but I realized not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://coq.inria.fr/refman/proof-engine/tactics.html&#34;&gt;Coq Tactics&lt;/a&gt;. Authoritative but dense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/index.html&#34;&gt;Logical Foundations&lt;/a&gt; (Software Foundations Volume 1). I think the order of ideas makes pedagogical sense but also makes it hard for me to look up particular tactics or concepts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Coq cheat sheets found by Googling ‚ÄúCoq cheat sheets‚Äù:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pjreddie.com/coq-tactics/&#34;&gt;Coq Tactics Index&lt;/a&gt; (Joseph Redmon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2018sp/a5/coq-tactics-cheatsheet.html&#34;&gt;Coq Tactics Cheatsheet&lt;/a&gt; (Cornell CS3110)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://adam.chlipala.net/itp/tactic-reference.html&#34;&gt;Coq Tactics Quick Reference&lt;/a&gt; (Adam Chlipala) / the &lt;a href=&#34;http://adam.chlipala.net/frap/&#34;&gt;Formal Reasoning About Programs&lt;/a&gt; book also has a nice appendix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~rrand/popl_2016/reference.html&#34;&gt;Coq Tactics&lt;/a&gt; (UPenn ???)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta-notes: I cover a lot of weak tactics because I like knowing exactly what my tools are doing. I try to use the variants of tactics that explicitly name things produced when possible. I am sure there is nomenclature I don‚Äôt understand precisely and use sloppily in this list; I am also sloppy with metavariables. Even things that are correct might be horrible style. There are likely other errors and omissions. They might be fixed one day. I‚Äôm putting this up nevertheless because it‚Äôs personally useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;things-i-wish-i-knew-but-didnt-learn-from-software-foundations-or-coq-tactic-cheat-sheets&#34;&gt;Things I wish I knew but didn‚Äôt learn from Software Foundations or Coq tactic cheat sheets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first two sections are not about tactics per se but how to find theorems to use and how to use them. Knowing how to use all of these query commands is super useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To clean up repeating subexpressions with ‚Äúlocal variables‚Äù, I find &lt;code&gt;remember expr as X eqn:Hname.&lt;/code&gt; easier to work with than &lt;code&gt;set (X := expr).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pose proof expr as Hname.&lt;/code&gt; adds &lt;code&gt;expr&lt;/code&gt; to the context, with name &lt;code&gt;Hname&lt;/code&gt;. Modus ponens where you know &lt;code&gt;H1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;H2&lt;/code&gt;, which is ‚Äú&lt;code&gt;H1&lt;/code&gt; implies &lt;code&gt;H3&lt;/code&gt;‚Äù, is just &lt;code&gt;pose proof (H2 H1) as H3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software Foundations covers bullets and curly braces early, but I like subgoal specification with &lt;code&gt;1:&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;2:&lt;/code&gt; etc., which can really help limit nesting depth. &lt;code&gt;2: (tactic that solves subgoal 2).&lt;/code&gt; If you want more bullets, there are infinitely many, not just three. After &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; you can use &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt; etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>diagrams Reference</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/ref/diagrams</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/ref/diagrams</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://diagrams.github.io/&#34;&gt;diagrams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a nifty Haskell library for making vector diagrams. I keep coming back to it to generate graphics for puzzles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the very old &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.vero.site/post/signature-puzzle&#34;&gt;A Signature Puzzle&lt;/a&gt; from this blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dp.puzzlehunt.net/puzzle/a-fork-in-the-road.html&#34;&gt;A Fork in the Road&lt;/a&gt; (DP Puzzle Hunt)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2020.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/symbols&#34;&gt;Symbols&lt;/a&gt; (Galactic Puzzle Hunt 2020)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://silphpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/a-lot-of-research&#34;&gt;A Lot of Research into Things That Have Very Little Meaning&lt;/a&gt; (Silph Puzzle Hunt)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got sick of relearning it every time, and I think there‚Äôs some small chance other people will find it useful too, so I wrote something up. This post is a sort of reference that tries to compromise between the &lt;a href=&#34;https://diagrams.github.io/doc/quickstart.html&#34;&gt;quick start tutorial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://diagrams.github.io/doc/manual.html&#34;&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt; on one hand, and the API reference on the other, to try to be deeper and more comprehensive than the former, but also flow better and be easier to navigate than the latter. Some types are just really intimidating when fully written out‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb1&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;cb1-1&#34; title=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;circle ::&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;TrailLike&lt;/span&gt; t, &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;V&lt;/span&gt; t &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;V2&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; t &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt; n, &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;Transformable&lt;/span&gt; t) &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; n &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid unhelpfully generic types, I will deal concretely with two-dimensional diagrams that measure everything in &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt;, and will frequently abbreviate complex types with an asterisk, like I will write &lt;code&gt;V2*&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;V2 Double&lt;/code&gt;. I will introduce these aliases along the way for easy greppability. They‚Äôre not legal Haskell, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reference assumes basic-to-intermediate Haskell knowledge. Some of the more intermediate stuff includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monoids, and that the Haskell &lt;code&gt;Monoid&lt;/code&gt; operator is &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typeclasses. I will sometimes write fake type signatures as abbreviations for typeclass restrictions: for example, &lt;code&gt;TrailLike&lt;/code&gt; is a typeclass, and I might say or write that a function returns &lt;code&gt;TrailLike&lt;/code&gt; when I really mean &lt;code&gt;TrailLike t =&amp;gt; t&lt;/code&gt;, any type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; that is in that typeclass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;van Laarhoven lenses may help, but mostly I‚Äôll try to black-box them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Very simple to explain: if \(P\) is a statement, \([P]\) is 1 if \(P\) is true and 0 if not. So for example
\[\begin{aligned} \lbrack 1 &amp;lt; 2\rbrack &amp;amp;= 1 \\ \lbrack 1 &amp;gt; 2\rbrack &amp;amp;= 0 \end{aligned}\]
It‚Äôs like using a boolean as an integer in C or Python.
It‚Äôs useful to keep yourself organized when you‚Äôre writing summations, especially if you‚Äôre summing across terms with a weird condition or if you need to exchange two sums.</description>

      <title>Java Clipboards and Data Transfer</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/ref/java-clipboards</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/ref/java-clipboards</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Ported from betaveros.stash. Wow, I get syntax highlighting and footnotes! Probably years out of date though. I probably wrote this somewhere in 2012‚Äì2014, but am editing this parenthetical in 2021.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick brief guide. At least, that‚Äôs how I planned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of stuff is in the package &lt;code&gt;java.awt.datatransfer&lt;/code&gt;. Class &lt;code&gt;Toolkit&lt;/code&gt; is in &lt;code&gt;java.awt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some basic classes. The class &lt;code&gt;Clipboard&lt;/code&gt; is a clipboard, obviously. Its content is/will be an instance of the class &lt;code&gt;Transferable&lt;/code&gt;. Some content can be read as different types of objects depending on what you want; to choose which type you use an instance of &lt;code&gt;DataFlavor&lt;/code&gt;. It provides three basic ones: &lt;code&gt;DataFlavor.imageFlavor&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DataFlavor.javaFileListFlavor&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;DataFlavor.stringFlavor&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, now step by step. This is the low-level method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&#34;1&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the default clipboard with &lt;code&gt;Clipboard clipboard = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getSystemClipboard();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a transferable with &lt;code&gt;Transferable content = clipboard.getContents(null);&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check if &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; can be read as the kind of object you want with &lt;code&gt;(content != null) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; content.isDataFlavorSupported(someFlavor)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it does, get the object with &lt;code&gt;content.getTransferData(someFlavor)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just want a quick-and-dirty function:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>This is a matrix.
\[\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 \\\\ 4 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; 6 \end{bmatrix}\]
It has 2 rows and 3 columns, so it is a \(2 \times 3\) matrix.
Matrix addition and multiplication-by-a-scalar is done componentwise. Matrix multiplication is done trickily; it‚Äôs associative, distributive, commutative with scalars, linear, anticommutative-under-transposition.
Vectors are like columns of matrices, or matrices with one column. Except row vectors are rows of matrices.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;limit-limit&#34;&gt;Limit + Limit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheaply, using an &lt;a href=&#34;%7B%%20post_url%202014-10-21-iverson-bracket%20%%7D&#34;&gt;Iverson bracket&lt;/a&gt; expression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\begin{aligned}
\lim_{a \to \infty} \lim_{b \to \infty} [a &amp;gt; b] &amp;amp;= 0 \\
\lim_{b \to \infty} \lim_{a \to \infty} [a &amp;gt; b] &amp;amp;= 1
\end{aligned}
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more continuity, use &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\frac{a}{a + b}\)&lt;/span&gt; instead (Rudin Example 7.2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniform convergence on one limit suffices to allow this exchange, almost by definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;limit-continuity&#34;&gt;Limit + Continuity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
f_\epsilon(x) = \begin{cases} 0 &amp;amp; \text{if } |x| \geq \epsilon \\ 1 - \left|\frac{x}{\epsilon}\right| &amp;amp;\text{if } |x| &amp;lt; \epsilon \end{cases}.

&lt;p&gt;The regex employed is essentially &lt;code&gt;/\b([A2-9TJQK]|10)([CDHS])\b/g&lt;/code&gt;. You have to type in uppercase (otherwise even ‚Äúas‚Äù would be filtered).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Certain notable problems that I don‚Äôt want to look through a zillion pages to find.
 Iran TST 1996, notoriously reposted at least 35 times on AoPS (okay, many of these are actually modifications):
If \(x, y, z &amp;gt; 0\) then
\[(xy+yz+zx)\left(\frac{1}{(x+y)^2} + \frac{1}{(y+z)^2} + \frac{1}{(z+x)^2}\right) \geq \frac{9}{4}\] ISL 1988 #4: if \(1, 2, \ldots, n^2\) are placed in a \(n \times n\) chessboard, some two adjacent numbers differ by at least \(n\) USAMO 1995.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Brevity has been chosen over accuracy because the whole point is that you should know this stuff already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-2-basic-topology-some-ch.-3&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: Basic Topology (+ some Ch. 3)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;isolated point&lt;/strong&gt; of E is in E but not a limit point of it. E is &lt;strong&gt;perfect&lt;/strong&gt; if it is exactly equal to its set of limit points. Equivalently, it is closed and has no isolated points. Ex. 2.44: The Cantor set is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;compact set&lt;/strong&gt; is a set for which every open cover has a finite subcover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compactness or compact sets have these properties (with made-up names):&lt;/p&gt;</description>
