<meta name="description" content="Yes, it’s official now. I’m on the 2012 International Mathematical Olympiad team bound for Argentina, and if I didn’t make a post about this I would be ashamed to call myself a blogger. So, a little moment of smug self-satisfaction should be justified, I hope? And not to mention, last year’s title of youngest Taiwan contestant is not yet passed? Let’s cue the evil laughter!
…or maybe not.
Here is a simple tabulation of our selection problems:
GA/GN/CG/GNC/NGA AG/CA/NG/GCN/AGA GA/GN/CA/GCN/AGC  Algebra x9, Combinatorics x7, Geometry x12, Number Theory x8. In other words a distribution in perfect negative correlation with my estimated ability in each subject. At least, that’s how I’ve always estimated them before about a month ago. Ouch, the last stage was the only one of the three where problem distribution for combinatorics actually reached its fair share. (Alternative interpretation: 2011’s distribution was majorly f123ed up with only one real geometry problem, which just means that this year’s battle will probably be difficult for me. (Alternative alternative interpretation: the evil, nasty, wicked, depraved windmill was actually an outrageous negative for me. Gee, I don’t know how to feel. But I should actually do stuff instead of wildly speculating; let’s get back to the topic.)) The last stage of selection had a pretty steady “Individual Study” was steady. The first mock test had slightly easy problems as 1 and 2 and a completely insurmountable NT problem that was basically adding a zillion unrelated numbers up and having the result magically be divisible by a prime. I finished the first two problems in an hour and spent three and a half on the third, calculating over a hundred values modulo 19 trying to find a pattern. Nothing.

<p>…or maybe not.</p>
<p>Here is a simple tabulation of our selection problems:</p>
<ol type="1">

<li>GA/GN/CA/GCN/AGC</li>

<p>Algebra x9, Combinatorics x7, Geometry x12, Number Theory x8. In other words a distribution in perfect negative correlation with my estimated ability in each subject. At least, that’s how I’ve always estimated them before about a month ago. Ouch, the last stage was the only one of the three where problem distribution for combinatorics actually reached its fair share. (Alternative interpretation: 2011’s distribution was majorly f123ed up with only one real geometry problem, which just means that this year’s battle will probably be difficult for me. (Alternative alternative interpretation: the evil, nasty, wicked, depraved windmill was actually an outrageous negative for me. Gee, I don’t know how to feel. But I should actually do stuff instead of wildly speculating; let’s get back to the topic.))  The last stage of selection had a pretty steady “Individual Study” was steady. The first mock test had slightly easy problems as 1 and 2 and a completely insurmountable NT problem that was basically adding a zillion unrelated numbers up and having the result magically be divisible by a prime. I finished the first two problems in an hour and spent three and a half on the third, calculating over a hundred values modulo 19 trying to find a pattern. Nothing.</p>
<p>The second mock test was pretty crazy though… an algebra problem given to us by PYC for #4, shortlist G4 as #5, shortlist C6 for #6. #4 looked innocuous, but I waded into the algebraic structure randomly and bam! Wild Logarithm appeared! I stumbled through it despite it more-or-less devolving into a wickedly non-standard functional equation, because it was a #4, and the #4 two weeks ago was also essentially a functional equation and also evil-looking but not very hard but which I had failed. <em>Important lesson: Figuring out when to switch problems is hard!</em> But I dealt with it and was relieved.</p>
<p>#5 was a weakened G4 (part I: cite obvious theorem, part II: draw twenty different magical auxiliary lines). I didn’t take very long to solve #6… a few small cases and I had a complete procedure, after which I quickly returned to #5. I regretted not taking the time to really learn complex bash; I couldn’t even figure out how to drop the perpendicular from a point on the unit circle onto another chord. The tiny bit of regret at losing any chance at significant partial credit was how I ended the test.</p>
<p>Amazingly, after the tests were turned in, I learned that my performance was ridiculous on the opposite side of the scale. <em>Nobody else had found the magical logarithm solution</em>. Most people had only solved or tried #5; some people had stumbled through #4 and found only the all-constant solution, which I was pretty sure was wrong since I verified my magical logarithm solution carefully. Most people stayed away from #6 and nobody else solved it either. So this left me with the crazy situation of being the only person to solve #4 and the only person to solve #6. Not to mention (1) the trivial first part of #5 was worth <em>three out of seven</em> and (2) CLK said my #6 solution was simpler than the official one.</p>
<p>All this meant that I was really not surprised to see my name on the list, ready for lots more problem barraging and PuyoPuyo battles, although this also unfortunately means tons of skipped classes I will have to prepare to make up for, plus the hassle of graduation trip and performance and blah blah blah. It’s not an easy task, that much I will say. But I also feel like my whole passion for math thing has been recharged, so I still have the drive to be in it for the math, as opposed to the competition feeling or scholarships or huge advantage at entering an Ivy League school.</p>
<p>Great, another anticlimactic conclusion paragraph. Okay, the post title sounds cool but only barely makes sense. I’m sorry.</p></article>
