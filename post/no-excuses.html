<meta name="description" content="Wow, this has been the longest silence on this blog in a long time.
I can’t justify it with lack of time either. Interning at Dropbox takes up all of my weekdays, but my weekends are much freer than I’m used to. I carelessly let two weeks at home in Taiwan pass by without doing much about blogging, and once again a lot of my few blog drafts have drifted into the temporally awkward zone, being too far away from the events they are about.
Neither is it for lack of things happening. At MIT, there was the Senior House turnaround and freshman moratorium. I can’t even begin to sum up the discussion around this issue, but I think the best response I’ve read is this open letter. Then there’s the official Senior House response. But that’s enough links, since I imagine the chances that this issue is relevant to you and you’d need this blog to link you to them if you’re reading this are pretty low. (Then again, the chances that you’re reading this are already pretty low. Although the chances you are reading this right now is 100%.)

	<article><p>Wow, this has been the longest silence on this blog in a long time.</p>
<p>I can’t justify it with lack of time either. Interning at Dropbox takes up all of my weekdays, but my weekends are much freer than I’m used to. I carelessly let two weeks at home in Taiwan pass by without doing much about blogging, and once again a lot of my few blog drafts have drifted into the temporally awkward zone, being too far away from the events they are about.</p>
<p>Neither is it for lack of things happening. At MIT, there was the <a href="http://thetech.com/2016/06/10/senior-house-turnaround-announced">Senior House turnaround and freshman moratorium</a>. I can’t even begin to sum up the discussion around this issue, but I think <a href="https://medium.com/@hollyhaney/an-open-letter-to-chancellor-barnhart-from-a-senior-house-resident-efc107e789ab#.a1psbheao">the best response I’ve read is this open letter</a>. Then there’s the <a href="http://seniorhouse.mit.edu/">official Senior House response</a>. But that’s enough links, since I imagine the chances that this issue is relevant to you <em>and</em> you’d need this blog to link you to them if you’re reading this are pretty low. (Then again, the chances that you’re reading this are already pretty low. Although the chances <em>you</em> are reading this right now is 100%.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then there was the Orlando <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie#Death">shooting of Christina Grimmie</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Orlando_nightclub_shooting">nightclub shooting</a>, which I even more probably don’t need to link to. I will just say that Vi Hart made this video and I watched it a couple times.</p>

</div>

<p>And finally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union">Brexit</a> happened, which affects the most people but which I understand the least. Well, I do want to note that it seems lots of people are reading unreasonably much into the Google Trend about UK searches for “What is the EU?”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;What is the EU?&quot; is the second top UK question on the EU since the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EURefResults?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EURefResults</a> were officially announced <a href="https://t.co/1q4VAX3qcm">pic.twitter.com/1q4VAX3qcm</a></p>&mdash; GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/746303118820937728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>People seized on this as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/06/24/the-british-are-frantically-googling-what-the-eu-is-hours-after-voting-to-leave-it/">evidence that British voters didn’t know what they were voting for</a>, but I don’t think it shows that at all, for a lot of reasons…</p>
<ol>
<li>
The query is a very simple question; its search count will be exaggerated relative to more complicated queries, which might be phrased in slightly different ways that won’t get aggregated.
</li>
<li>
Googling that question doesn’t necessarily mean you don’t know what the EU is; it might just be how you interact with Google and get a list of information or different opinions about the EU.
</li>
<li>
The searches could come from children or tourists or others who couldn’t vote and only decided to learn about the referendum after it passed and started mattering. Even a few of these people could make the question rank highly; the ranking doesn’t have any absolute numbers.
</li>
<li>
Why am I making this list. This takedown, <a href="https://medium.com/@dannypage/stop-using-google-trends-a5014dd32588#.9l5av5tlh">Stop Using Google Trends</a>, has far more details and is more entertaining anyway.
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is your every-so-often dose of unnecessary current events recapping. You are now all caught up. If you are reading this blog as your primary news source… stop doing that.</p>
<p>(And finally finally on a personal note, I didn’t make Google Code Jam World Finals, so I can put that aside, and maybe at some point put out the blog draft about last year online rounds…)</p>
<p>The question remains in the air, though; why haven’t I blogged?</p>
<p>I spent a long time listing a bunch of excuses and then deleting them. (I kept the above non-excuses because this post needs to have <em>something</em> in it.) I don’t have a good reason; the closest I can come is to say, it’s like I’m living a new life in a new place to a new schedule, a life that I haven’t integrated blogging into the flow of yet, and this post is actually part of that integration process.</p>
<p>So the commitment device returneth! Expect <strong>one post every weekend</strong> until my internship ends.</p></article>
