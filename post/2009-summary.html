<p><strong>Note</strong>: This post is backdated. I am writing this post in 2018 because, as part of the <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/remigration">Big 2017 Remigration</a>, I have decided to delete most of the posts because they were too embarrassing and sparse on information, but figured I might keep a rundown of the highlights.</p>

<p>2009, on this blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ah, yes, the point at which I <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/winter">found the Eragon video game</a> on my cousin’s PSP and was really psyched to be playing a game with “blood and merciless killing” and <em>riding a dragon</em>. (But I didn’t say the last part, so I’m not completely sure if I’m projecting onto my past self, or if Brian<sub>2009</sub> was already trying to display discretion about said point of itnerest.) A few months later I revisited it and <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/more-random-blathering">was disappointed to find that the game had been deleted.</a>.</li>
<li>Here is a small “puzzle” I proposed: fill in the question marks with words such that each word ends with some suffix of 2 to 4 letters that the next word starts with. “converter” → “?????” → “??????” → “awesome”.</li>
<li>I was really excited, like, 252 exclamation marks in a row excited, when I found out that Eoin Colfer was going to write the sixth and final <cite>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</cite> book. (My impression of it from however later I read it was that I felt he was trying too hard to emulate Adams’s style and it came off as a bit forced.)</li>
<li>I listed a bunch of text adventures, starting with Zork and ending with Anchorhead, followed then by “Tower of Hanoi”. What?</li>
<li>I <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/back-from-math-camp">learned what AM-GM was</a>, and typed the inequality out in ASCII art. In the same post, I learned about microblogging. I wondered whether it might suit me. One reason I thought I might not like it is that I liked playing with ASCII art in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tags.</li>
<li>I compiled <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/new-goal">this list of goals</a>. How times have changed since 7 and 9, and to some extent 4. Side note: in the very next post after that one, I was counting down until I was old enough to make a Facbeook account and said that I needed to start thinking of a really good password. On the other hand, it’s kind of sad how I still haven’t succeeded in the first two.</li>
<li>“I love Fridays!!!!!!!!”</li>
<li>I once exited a metro station into a fitness center that I could not figure out to exit (and I could not reenter the metro station before paying again). As a result, I had very strong feelings towards whoever designed the building. I’m not sure if it’s valid to interpret this as faraway foreshadowing of my current user interface design leanings.</li>
<li>I ran 1500m a few times, and kept saying in various ways that it had a high chance of killing me, and hit a baseball at least once.</li>
<li>Wow, I was doing cryptic crosswords again. I quoted this clue: “I oscillate when changing places (10)”.</li>
<li>Some of my friends had blogs. Some of my friends asked me questions about HTML and CSS. This is probably a better indication of me becoming a front-end developer.</li>
<li>I liked Clockwords.</li>
<li><p>Here I <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/technological-fails">gripe about (among other things)</a></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>people telling me not to comment my code</li>
<li>people who don’t realize or don’t use Gmail stars and labels</li>
<li>links that say “click here” (which I knew to be bad for accessibility, e.g. screen readers, but now I know are also bad for people who just scan for links to click on). Wow.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wow, I have principles.</p></li>
