<title>Impact Minus Two Weeks</title>

<meta name="author" content="betaveros" />
<meta name="description" content="Wait, are you serious? Under two weeks left, is that what it’s come to?
What happened to my majestic plans to go over every functional equation I failed on, ever? Or to go through a super-intense geometry-immersion period and actually try to develop some of that crazy “intuition” thing? And I have finals coming up too! I just finished a ludicrous deadline-extended geography project that I am absolutely confident is the crappiest paper of my entire school career so far! And despite a semester of (slacking) classes, my Spanish is still only barely at a usable level! Exclamation marks!
Don’t panic… let’s focus on the positive. I am absolutely prepared with my stationery. I bought three spanking new 0.4mm pens that say “Can write for 1000 meters!” because all of my current ones are annoyingly thick and constantly having almost-but-not-quite run out, plus three new mechanical pencils and enough matching 2B lead to last me through college. All the pencils and lead are Pentel. I haven’t done any research, so if something terrible happens in Argentina I know what company to blame, and I am writing it here so I won’t confuse the brands. Also, in view of what happened to SCH’s carry-on baggage last year (luckily there was no geo on Day 1), I got an extra compass I hope won’t be needed.
While we’re listing all the stuff I have gotten ready:

	<article><p>Wait, are you serious? Under two weeks left, is that what it’s come to?</p>
<p>What happened to my majestic plans to go over every functional equation I failed on, ever? Or to go through a super-intense geometry-immersion period and actually try to develop some of that crazy “intuition” thing? And I have <em>finals</em> coming up too! I just finished a ludicrous deadline-extended geography project that I am absolutely confident is the crappiest paper of my entire school career so far! And despite a semester of (slacking) classes, my Spanish is still only barely at a usable level! Exclamation marks!</p>
<p>Don’t panic… let’s focus on the positive. I am absolutely prepared with my stationery. I bought three spanking new 0.4mm pens that say “Can write for 1000 meters!” because all of my current ones are annoyingly thick and constantly having almost-but-not-quite run out, plus three new mechanical pencils and enough matching 2B lead to last me through college. All the pencils and lead are Pentel. I haven’t done any research, so if something terrible happens in Argentina I know what company to blame, and I am writing it here so I won’t confuse the brands. Also, in view of what happened to SCH’s carry-on baggage last year (luckily there was no geo on Day 1), I got an extra compass I hope won’t be needed.</p>
<p>While we’re listing all the <em>stuff</em> I have gotten ready:</p>
<ul>
<li>instant noodles, just in case the cuisine halfway across the globe proves to be hostile, which, by Murphy, it will</li>
<li>chocolate, for the calories, also known as our last line of protection from hypothermia</li>
<li>not-really-chocolate-flavored nutrition in a can</li>
<li>oodles of gum, to clean my teeth and maybe keep me awake and busy when needed</li>
<li>an eye-mask and a cute inflatable neck-cushion, to let me sleep when needed despite being in an awkward position, which is going to be way too often</li>
<li>face masks, tissue, alcoholic sanitizer, a new toothbrush… the whole paranoid cleanliness brigade, anything to preserve my vulnerable body, as usual</li>
<li>new neon-yellow-green shoes, because the old ones happen to be near demise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, one aspect covered.</p>
<p>But of course physical commodities only get one so far… the environment and time difference are going to be monsters as well. A difference of eleven hours!?!? A crazy temperature range of -1 to 21 degrees Celsius? Maybe I should be more thankful for our warm temperate climate over here. But I’m still anchored to Taiwan’s time, not only due to the finals, but also that repeatedly-delayed musical performance on Thursday morning. Seriously, guys: this leaves me just over a week to adjust. Two hours a day. That’s inhuman by normal standards, and I still have chemo to make me persistently sluggish and unresponsive, including right now. Derp.</p>
<p>I’d hope for two combinatorics problems this year, but somehow given the score distributions these last two years I have a feeling that wouldn’t actually be the best thing to wish for. Regardless, I’m as ready as I’ll ever be.</p>
<p>Let the battle commence! And then let me enjoy some lazy summertime.</p>
<p>Two weeks.</p></article>
