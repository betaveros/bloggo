<p><em>Directions:</em> The questions in this test are multiple-choice questions. Each multiple-choice question on this test has four possible choices that may potentially be chosen as answers to the multiple-choice question. Read each multiple-choice question on this test and decide which of the four provided answers to the multiple-choice question on this test is the best answer to the multiple-choice question on this test. Find the row in your answer sheet with an adjacent number that completely matches the number of the multiple-choice question on this test you are working on. In the row in your answer sheet with an adjacent number that completely matches the number of the multiple-choice question on this test you are working on, fill in the oval with the same letter as the letter of the answer you selected as the answer from the four provided answers that may potentially be chosen as answers to the multiple-choice question on this test that you are working on that best answers the multiple-choice question on this test you are working on.</p>

<h3>
“Constructed Response: Reading Comprehension”
</h3>
<p><em>Directions:</em> Please answer the question in the space provided.</p>
<p>Question 1 is based on the passage below.</p>
<blockquote>
Firstly, the population growth in our civilization causes an equal growth in demand for subsistence. This forces humans to find a way to increase supply to match this, and one of the cheapest ways to do so is creating new farming land through deforestation. Scientists predict that, when we reach 2050, the world population will grow by 30%, accompanied by a 50% rise in needed food supplies. Unfortunately, the Earth and the land it provides for us to grow crops does not expand along with this. To increase yield from agriculture, deforestation is used to clear land and is much cheaper than other methods, such as buying more efficient machinery to assist farmers. Also, the climate of the forest is particularly suitable for a type of soy that scientists have developed. Soy is important in many people’s diets because it is an extremely protein-rich food, which is another reason why deforestation matches the increasing demand so well.
