	<p>Stopped by a friend’s house a few days ago to do homework, which somehow devolved into me analyzing what programming language I should try to learn next in a corner, which is completely irrelevant to the rest of this post. Oops.</p>
<p>Anyway, in normal-math-curriculum-land, my classmates are now learning about matrices. How to add them, how to multiply them, how to calculate the determinant and stuff. Being a nice person, and feeling somewhat guilty for my grade stability despite the number of study hours I siphoned off to puzzles and the like, I was eager to help confront the monster. Said classmate basically asked me what they were for.</p>
<p>Well, what a hard question. But of course given the curriculum it’s the only interesting problem I think could be asked.</p>
<p>When I was hurrying through the high-school curriculum I remember having to learn the same thing and not having any idea what the heck was happening. Matrices appeared in that section as a messy, burdensome way to solve equations and never again, at least not in an interesting enough way to make me remember. I don’t have my precalc textbook, but a supplementary precalc book completely confirms my impressions and “matrix” doesn’t even appear in my calculus textbook index. They virtually failed to show up in olympiad training too. I learned that Po-Shen Loh knew how to <a href="http://www.math.cmu.edu/~ploh/docs/math/mop2009/alg-comb.pdf">kill a bunch of combinatorics problems with them (PDF)</a>, but not in the slightest how to do that myself.</p>
<p>Somewhere else, during what I’m guessing was random independent exploration, I happened upon the signed-permutation-rule (a.k.a. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_determinants">Leibniz formula</a>) for evaluating determinants, which made a lot more sense for me and looked more beautiful and symmetric</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\det(A) = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \text{sgn}(\sigma) \prod_{i=1}^n A_{i,\sigma_i}\]</span></p>
<p>and I was annoyed when both of my linear algebra textbooks defined it first with cofactor expansion. Even though they quickly proved you could expand along any row or column, and one also followed up with the permutation formula a few sections later, it still felt uglier to me. Yes, it’s impossible to understand that equation without knowledge of permutations and their signs, but I’m very much a permutations kind of guy. Sue me.</p>

	<p>That’s not a picture. Why is it recreated as one? Oh well.</p>
<p>You can interpret this as me about reaching level 8.1 (the user ranking) on <a href="https://www.rankk.org/">rankk</a> or complaining about how infuriating level 8.1 (the puzzle) is. I’m torn.</p>

	<p>Most uncreative picture ever! But it’s suitable after <a href="http://puzzle.cisra.com.au/">CiSRA’s Puzzle Week</a>. This might be the first time our AoPS team managed all four puzzles in a group.</p>
<p>…sigh, now I must handle the guilt for squeezing out so much time from my normal schedule.</p>

	<p>Right, back to puzzles because I have nothing substantial to say. Circumstantial evidence suggests I created this one in June.</p>

	<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: My 2012 self wrote this. It is a little dated and does not entirely capture my current beliefs and attitudes, although I have to say it’s not too far off either. As of 2018, <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/me-and-facebook">Me and Facebook</a> is more relevant.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="/img/orange-comment.png"><img src="/img/orange-comment.png" alt="" title="orange-comment" width="458" height="85" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1383" /></a> Here’s a guilty secret: I like getting feedback.</p>
<p>I’m not restricting myself to painstakingly thoughtful comments that attempt to <em>build upon</em> and <em>transform</em> the post to form an interesting conversation, the kind English teachers are hellbent on promoting. Sure, I get the most kicks out of those, but I’m not picky. Even single-digit pageview bars or a handful of Facebook “like”s give me buzzes of excitement.</p>
<p>It’s a guilty feeling, because I also think that that these are unimaginably cheap internet currencies and should not qualify as “meaningful” under a rational mindset. I strongly suspect visitors accidentally click on my blog and leave after five seconds without taking in anything, because I do that all the time to other people’s blogs and sites. Sometimes it is out of boredom, sometimes it is because I actually have something of higher priority to do than indiscriminate reading, sometimes it is simply because I cannot read the language. I’ve seen plenty of people like posts on Facebook based on the poster, only occasionally taking into consideration the first word of the post in question, before actually reading them.</p>
<p>Yes, the proliferation of “liking” on Facebook bothers me. I don’t expect everybody to reply meaningfully to everything when they just want to express approval lightly. However, when I see that tiny minority of people handing them out to people in their own threads like programs at a concert, I become indignant. Under their influence, what was originally a straightforward, meaningful badge of appreciation becomes a handwavy gesture that carries virtually no weight, and then I don’t know what to do when I see something I like <em>seriously</em>. Will clicking that button still express the feeling strongly enough?</p>
<p>I accept that, in our stressful world, a few instant effortless gags that take ten seconds to fully process and approve deserve a place. Nevertheless, the number of people who seem to want to make the “like” a completely passive and automatic action is almost physically painful:</p>

	<p>This is a <a href="http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/fillomino.html">Fillomino</a> puzzle where every polyomino is required to be an L-shape, as in <a href="http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/sashigane.html">Sashigane</a>. Write a number in every empty cell so that every group of cells with the same number that is connected through its edges is an L-shape (with arms of positive length and 1-cell thickness) with that number of cells.</p>
<p>May be slightly reminiscent of <a href="http://mathgrant.blogspot.com/2011/09/monday-mutant-95-polyominous-no.html">no-rectangle Fillominoes</a>. <em>Slightly…</em> (Has anybody done this before? It seems so interesting that I feel like I couldn’t be first.)</p>

	<p>Yes. I know it’s been more than a month. Blogging motivation decreases, but the responsibility of that <em>stay tuned</em> doesn’t go away.</p>
<p>It’s okay. It’s all worth it because the stuff in the games room is absolutely ridiculous. Warning: huge post.</p>

	<p>I made this a long time ago but put it off until I had programmed enough to digitize it without my fingers leaving the home row. I think the finish is interesting.</p>

<p>Yeah, I lied last time I made one of these; the original Nikoli name wasn’t that hard to remember, and “sashigane puzzles” has shown up as a search query, so here you go. Perfect opposite-type-clue rotational symmetry, chaotic_iak! I hope you’re satisfied now.</p>
