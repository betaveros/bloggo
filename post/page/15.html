	<p>Yes. I know it’s been more than a month. Blogging motivation decreases, but the responsibility of that <em>stay tuned</em> doesn’t go away.</p>
<p>It’s okay. It’s all worth it because the stuff in the games room is absolutely ridiculous. Warning: huge post.</p>

<p>Yeah, I lied last time I made one of these; the original Nikoli name wasn’t that hard to remember, and “sashigane puzzles” has shown up as a search query, so here you go. Perfect opposite-type-clue rotational symmetry, chaotic_iak! I hope you’re satisfied now.</p>

	<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: My 2012 self wrote this. It’s a bit dated, but it’s okay, and also is of historical interest for featuring me explaining the CSS I learned from English class.</p>
</div>
<p>Every time I notice that I have hoarded a large number of strange assignments and essays from another school year of work I get all guilty. First there’s the knowledge about ancient Chinese dynasties and plant hormones that I only have shadows of recollections of, which makes me wonder whether all the time and effort invested by teachers, classmates, and myself have gone wasted.</p>
<p>I know, though, that given that I still sense these shadows, it shouldn’t be difficult to look up and relearn this stuff if I ever need to do so. This brings me to the non-factual parts of the learning, such as writing skills with all its variations. There’s persuasive writing, which I don’t use much because I can’t usually even persuade myself to take a side in anything, let alone others. There’s descriptive writing mode, which I don’t use much because the most vividly describable things I encounter are food, and the shallowness of piling flowery adjectives together to talk about food just makes me cringe nowadays. Previously, I wrote at least two such compositions in sixth grade. Blech.</p>

	<ins datetime="2012-12-03T13:52:25+00:00">
[edit: okay guys I’m surprised at many people come here with search queries looking for solutions. If you want IMO solutions, <a href="http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewforum.php?f=834">the corresponding AoPS forum</a> invariably has many of them. This is probably late-ish, but just in case.]
</ins>
<p>Day 2 of the contest.</p>
<p>Did you know that in Chinese [or Mandarin, whatever] “four” is unlucky because it’s a homophone for “death”, and hospitals tend to skip it in floors or ward numbers?</p>
<p>Did you know that there was going to be an anecdote involving the seventh Artemis Fowl book but I couldn’t make it work so instead you have a weird and utterly disconnected metareference to something deleted?</p>
<p>I don’t know, it sounded cool at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4.</strong> Find all functions f: Z → Z such that, for all integers a,b,c that satisfy a+b+c = 0, the following equality holds: <span class="math display">\[f(a)^2+f(b)^2+f(c)^2=2f(a)f(b)+2f(b)f(c)+2f(c)f(a).\]</span> (Here Z denotes the set of integers.)</p>
<p>An innocent-looking functional equation, but once you start trying it you discover that there’s quite some depth to it. Random guessing can yield that <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x^2\)</span> is a solution, so I proved inductively that after dividing out a constant f(1) then the remaining part of f is a perfect square. Letting <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = f(1)g(x)^2\)</span> with g(x) a nonnegative integer and factorizing the original equation, I got an auxiliary functional equation equivalent to the original equation.</p>

	<p>I have just realized that I have only ever tried one level of difficulty in puzzle construction, viz., “as hard as I can make it”. This is mainly because I don’t want to construct anything overly trivial with the same few tricks, but, well, maybe it’s not the best idea for actually trying to build an audience.</p>
<p>Am I actually trying to build an audience? Am I? *shudders*</p>
<p>(Yajilin summary: fill in some cells, draw a loop through the rest, filled cells aren’t adjacent, arrows denote # of filled cells along some ray; <a href="https://mellowmelon.wordpress.com/yajilin/">MellowMelon’s rules</a>)</p>

	<p>I could spend all day coming up with post titles like this one. Really, I could. Anyway, after receiving the letter gently reminding me to turn in the official IMO report in Chinese, I finished that first and turned it in. This, plus the fact that I don’t have any way to do any of my summer homework yet, should make continued blogging much easier.</p>
<p>These months of preparation and anticipation, and in just over two days it will be behind us forever.</p>
<p>Thus were my thoughts at 3:30 in the morning, which were a much worse method of preparation than that which I used for the APMO, which involved trying for the first time to put my compass in its box and staring at a cryptic crossword. Twisted thoughts as I lay innocently in bed, trying to preserve my spirit and mathematical function. I got up at 6:30 and ate a breakfast nervously with the team.</p>
<p>We dispersed into the contest hall. Flat squarish white tables in orderly rows greeted us. They were considerably smaller than the arm-span tables we had last year in the Netherlands’ stadium, but the space was still ample compared to the ones we took our practice tests on at home. I floundered a bit looking for whoever was supposed to check our stuff for forbidden items, but none of the proctors paid any attention to that, so I flipped through my own jacket pockets paranoidly.</p>
<p>But preparation was too brief, and there were at least fifteen minutes left with nothing to do except try not to panic. I managed to fill these fifteen minutes by doing elaborate breathing exercises, raising and flapping my arms, counting down seconds, focusing on a color word, meditating badly, clearing out everything nonmathematical from my mind with a symbolic gesture. This is not a very coherent description, but I wasn’t feeling very coherent.</p>
<p>I opened an eye halfway and watched as the clock ticked down the last few seconds. The starting signal sounded. I opened up the problem envelope…  (nonessential expressions deLaTeXed; you’re welcome)</p>

Liars satisfy the “dynasty” rule i.e. liars are not orthogonally adjacent and non-liars are connected through sides.)</p>

Short rules: draw a loop along the grid lines; each numbered cell is in the loop and the number denotes how many cells can be seen vertically or horizontally from that cell, plus the cell itself.

	<p>Who knew coming up with strangely cryptic and illogical but nice-sounding post titles was so much fun!?</p>
<p>Okay, this break in storytelling is mainly brought to you by generic summer laziness, as well as possibly a tiny bit of chemotherapy adverse effect. There is only a little perfectionism involved, and that’s because this post contains a long awkward situation (you might have guessed already). I guess this is what it feels like to have oodles of stuff to blog about, but not enough motivation. Heck, these few days with running the TAIMC have long filled my list of rant topics with juicy stories until it’s near-bursting. But I need to end this self-pity party before I get carried away, so… back to the action.</p>
<p>Stranded in a foreign country at least 20 degrees Celsius below our comfort zone, having worn the same clothes for 36 hours of airplane travel, and still with less than 48 hours until the contest and <em>zero out of six compasses</em>, we were running out of options.</p>
<p>A quick inventory of clothes showed that, after including the vests and caps in the backpacks we got, we probably had just enough clothes to survive the cruel frigid environment. So, reluctantly, we left the games room and hit the street to hunt down some underwear and socks to change into. Not to mention toothbrushes and some T-shirts and jackets for good measure, because the inside of the hotel was not the right temperature for full cold-resistance gear.</p>
<p>Some haphazard wandering up and down the streets later, we found a store that suited our needs and picked up some clothes. The underwear came in two sizes: too loose and too tight. We picked the latter. Oh well, it would only be for a day or so… right?  And so that was our first day without our luggage. We survived. My iPod finally ran out of battery the second day while furiously refreshing my email, trying to stay connected and update everybody. The schedule marched ahead without us.</p>
