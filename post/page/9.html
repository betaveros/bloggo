<p>Note on notation: I’m going to use <span class="math inline">\(\text{Stab}(x)\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(G_x\)</span> for the stabilizer subgroup and <span class="math inline">\(\text{Cl}(x)\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(^Gx\)</span> for the conjugacy classes. For the orbit of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> I’ll stick with the norm and use <span class="math inline">\(Gx\)</span>, although it’s only used in confusing summation notation that I’ll explain with words too.</p>
<hr />
<p>We keep using this silly counting argument which I thought was something like Burnside’s lemma but actually is a lot simpler, just partitioning the set into orbits and slapping the orbit-stabilizer theorem on.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is the group and <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the set then</p>

<p>Note on notation: to be maximally clear, I have bolded all my vectors and put tiny arrows on them. Normal letters are usually reals, uppercase letters are usually bigger matrices. Also, <span class="math inline">\(\cdot^T\)</span> denotes the transpose of a matrix.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\textbf{v}}_1, \ldots, \vec{\textbf{v}}_m\)</span> be elements of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(m \leq n\)</span>, i.e. column vectors with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> real elements. Let <span class="math inline">\(V = [\vec{\textbf{v}}_1, \ldots, \vec{\textbf{v}}_m]\)</span>. This means pasting the column vectors together to make an <span class="math inline">\(n \times m\)</span> matrix (<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> rows <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> columns).</p>
<p>Consider the thing <span class="math inline">\(\vec{\textbf{v}}_1 \wedge \vec{\textbf{v}}_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge \vec{\textbf{v}}_m\)</span>, which can be visualized as the hyperparallelogram <span class="math inline">\(\left\{\sum_{i=1}^{m} t_i\vec{\textbf{v}}_i \,\middle\vert\, t_i \in [0,1], i = 1, 2, \ldots, m \right\}\)</span> but is apparently a different thing in a different vector space of things. We wonder how to compute <strong>the hyperarea of this hyperparallelogram</strong>.</p>

	<p>CLICKBAIT PERSONALITY TEST THAT YOU CAN DO WITHOUT SOLVING THE PUZZLE: What do you see in the puzzle image below? I have my own thoughts but I won’t bias you by posting them yet. Sound out your thoughts in the comments below! (I don’t expect this to work but I’d love to be proven wrong)</p>
<p>Okay so apparently how puzzles work is I go nearly a year without posting one and then when I post a terrible one, I feel guilty and obligated to post a legitimate one soon after. Testsolved by chaotic_iak.</p>
<p>This is a Fillomino (write a number in every empty cell so that every group of cells with the same number that is connected through its edges has that number of cells) where each tetromino has had their 4s replaced by one of L, I, T, or S describing their shape, and they obey the rules of LITS — they can touch if they are not congruent, they must all be connected, and their squares cannot form a 2×2 block. In addition, cells separated by a thick border may not contain the same number or letter.</p>

<p>Okay I’m sorry this is a horrible puzzle where the rules don’t make sense and I didn’t even get it testsolved. I just wanted an image to concisely demonstrate the capabilities of <a href="https://github.com/betaveros/gridderface">gridderface</a>, my puzzle marking and creation program, for the project homepage, after somebody expressed interest in using the program to write a puzzle. Then I got tremendously carried away.</p>

	<p>These are the thoughts that sometimes keep me awake at night.</p>
<p>These are things I don’t want to think about. These are things I’ve spent hours thinking about, never productively. They are worrying, but unlike typical worries in my life, it is fundamentally impractical to take steps to resolve or mitigate them, after which I may rest assured that I’ve done my best. The reason is that they also happen to be either untestable/unfalsifiable or only testable if one incurs absurd and irreversible costs, mainly dying.</p>
<p>Sometimes I explain them away to myself successfully and move on. Sometimes I read what I’ve written and think about these thoughts and do the cognitive equivalent of looking at them funny, as I’m expecting most readers to feel if they get that far — why would anybody be bothered, or afraid, or soul-crushingly panicked about these things? Life is so busy, there are literally more than sixty-four items on my HabitRPG to-do list, and besides, there are so many serious global issues humanity is actually facing right now, and people who are actually deprived of basic rights and resources and have to struggle to stay alive. How can I possibly be bothered by these absurd remote thoughts?</p>
<p>But I know that other times I do feel those emotions exactly. And if I stare <em>just right</em>, I can feel those emotions bubbling beneath the surface in me. Sometimes I can’t explain the issues away to myself, and a deep soul-sucking pang grows in my stomach. I’m irrational — I’m afraid of some of these thoughts — and I have submitted to the fact that there are some edges of my irrationality that would not be worth the effort to fix if just not thinking about them is better.</p>
<p>Sometimes these thoughts make me wish I were not so rational. Sometimes they even make me wish I were religious; it would be easier if (I believed) consciousness were, somehow, special. I suspect if I tried really hard, I could make myself believe something like that sincerely. But I think that’s a betrayal of myself I’m not willing to take. I think there are better ways to remain happy.</p>
<p>I want to maximize happiness. Thinking about more general moral principles will help with that, but the remoteness of these particular thoughts is such that I doubt I’ll ever have to make a choice that would benefit from me having thought about them. At least, I think the chance is small enough to not be worth the negative utility spent thinking about them.</p>
<p>So: “There is nothing to fear but fear itself.”</p>
<p>But I feel frustrated: not thinking about something just doesn’t seem like a solution. I don’t know how to come to terms with just how irrational happiness fundamentally is. And I still can’t resist thinking about them sometimes…</p>

	<p>Well, it’s been over a week, which is a long time for blog posts to be delayed after the event they’re documenting in probably all of the world except my blog. So.</p>
<p>I guess this post should start with a bit of background. I’ve been puzzlehunting for… wow, three and a half years now. I was introduced to puzzlehunts from AoPS, when some fellow members got together a team for <a href="http://puzzle.cisra.com.au/2011/teamstats_AoPS.html">CiSRA 2011</a>, and I think I’ve participated to some degree in every known internet Australian puzzlehunt since.</p>

	<p>Some notes.</p>
<p>I’m assuming you want to use D largely, but not entirely, for competitive programming. That’s me right now.</p>
<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
<p>Syntax is very similar. Function definitions, semicolon-terminated statements, variable declarations, and so on. You can declare <code>int main() {...}</code> or <code>void main() {...}</code> or something with arguments.</p>
<p>Basic types like <code>bool</code> and <code>int</code> and <code>double</code> are all there. Wonderfully, <code>long</code> is 64 bits. Instead of <code>unsigned</code> whatever, just prefix a <code>u</code>, e.g. <code>uint</code>.</p>
<p>Arithmetic operators and bit operators are all there too, including unsigned right shift <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. Although <code>^</code> is still xor, D has exponentiation as <code>^^</code>. Sadly, <code>%</code> is still same-sign remainder; there’s no true mod.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode d"><code class="sourceCode d"><div class="sourceLine" id="1" href="#1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">import</span> std.stdio;</div></code></pre>
<p>Casts look like <code>cast(int) x;</code></p>
<h3 id="control-flow">Control Flow</h3>
<p><code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>do</code>, and even <code>switch</code> all work as you’d expect, along with <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>.</p>
<p><code>foreach</code> is the nice addition though. Not only can you iterate over arrays and stuff, but range loops go like:</p>

<p>Well, there are better memory-triggering songs but I think this pretty much sums up how I feel about blogging right now (possibly including the very act of choosing that song.) And college apps. And life. Plus, the music video is silly in its own incredible way.</p>
<p>Anyway. Around this time a year ago, I made <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/time">a post</a> talking about how around a year before that,</p>
<blockquote>
I paused my participation in big high-school competitions, for a variety of reasons.
</blockquote>
<p>And then I rambled on life and programming competitions.</p>
<p>If you didn’t get it yet, this post so far has been written to meaningfully echo the last one. Nothing so abrupt has happened this year, but I just realized how nice it was to have a paragraph humorously listing the weird stuff I had gotten myself into over the course of 2013, so I’m going to do so again, even more completely.  (Broken into headers for easy skipping by people who don’t care for reading about certain categories.)</p>

	<p>This post, or most of it, was published password-protected once because… well, I explain that below. (To the one person who actually bothered asking me for the password, just so you know, I did add and rewrite parts. More than a few.) I forgot how distinctly powerful a disincentive a large 2300-word block of text is to the average person, especially when the subject of half of those 2300 words is teenage angst (I’ve already linked to <a href="https://xkcd.com/1370/">xkcd 1370</a> in enough places so I’m not even going to embed it here) interweaved with an insufferable amount of rationalist jargon. This will probably filter my readership more than sufficiently already.</p>
<p>I have still decided to protect one detail of the thought process, though. But even after that, I guess I do care more about how many people read this than I do for most of my other posts, so here’s a primitive attempt to gauge interest; if you choose anything beyond the first choice, I would also appreciate if you leave a comment, even if you don’t think you have anything to add:</p>

<hr />
<p>I haven’t posted for a long period again, but I don’t feel too bad about it.</p>
<p>Well, until I look carefully at my blog draft folder and remember that I have 90%-finished drafts about the two debate competitions I went to (November 2013 and March 2014), and winning the previous Mystery Hunt (January 2014), and my summer trip to Penghu (July 2013). Which will probably never get posted out of awkwardness.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>But I’ve been busy, completely righteously busy, with college apps to write and algorithm classes to teach and speeches to write and a math club to sort-of lead and all the typical homework besides.</p>
<p>And then (for those of you who don’t have me as a friend on Facebook) I got accepted to MIT and Caltech early.</p>
<p>And for a few days after that, I checked Facebook about sixteen times a day for the Class of 2019 group discussion, except for one day when I really needed not to, thanks to the power of committing to my HabitRPG party to do something. I am increasingly learning that procrastination is something that has to be actively and strategically fought. But that’s not what this post is about.</p>
