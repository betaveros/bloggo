	<p>This is not Part 3. It’s just two things I thought of tacking on to <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/more-fiction-2">part 2</a>.</p>
<p>What can I say? Part 2s are easy blog post fodder; Part 2 appendixes are even easier.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One, there’s one other wall I run into often during those rare attempts when I get motivated enough to try to write a story: naming characters is hard. At least, it provides an excellent motivational roadblock whenever I even consider committing a story to paper, a point before I’ve actually written anything at which I think “maybe I should give up and go on Facebook instead” and proceed to do so. Aggh. And I think there’s more than one reason for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
I have trouble coming up with names to some degree. Sure, it’s easy to browse BabyNames.com and look for choices, but a lot of the names there are really weird and contemplating them for every unimportant character kind of rips me out of the immersed mindset.
</li>
<li>
Reading great stories in English class and elsewhere may have gotten me feeling like every name ought to be a deep meaningful allusion, or at least pun fodder. I feel like I will regret it if I write a story and, a few months and/or chapters down the road, realize I missed a better name or the name I chose has some undesirable connotations in context or provides an atmosphere-ruining coincidence.
</li>
<li>
<p>But I think the real kicker is simply that some part of me is terrified of the awkwardness of giving a character the same name as anybody I know, because then they might read the story and wonder if the character is somehow based on them. And too many of the names that I consider common enough to not lure readers off into looking for hidden meanings are used up that way. This is obviously worst if the character is an antagonist. But it seems just as awkward if the character is a protagonist in accord with everything I’ve written, i.e. a paper-thin character blatantly created for escapist purposes. I am already kind of terrified I might ever meet anybody with the same name as one of my mentally established characters even though I haven’t actually written anything about him. And there’s a well-established convention of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">not reusing a first name in a work</a>, so this gets even harder with every work; I’m just as worried, what if somebody thinks this character is related to the other character in that story I wrote in second grade? Oh no!!</p>
<p>It’s like not reusing variable names in a programming language where everything is in the same scope. Positively nightmarish.</p>
And I actually discovered some evidence this is a thing in my past: I found some stories I wrote in 2004. They are possibly the most extreme exemplification of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhatYouKnow">Write What You Know</a> imaginable: the main character, Michael, goes to school and makes friends. That’s all.

<p>I kind of want to share these stories, but fast-forward a few years and you’ll see that a classmate named Michael entered my grade and we stayed in the same grade until we graduated.</p>

	<p>Wow, there are so many cool things in my old folder. I could probably create and schedule enough filler posts to make my <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">streak</a> last through my week-long trip and back. I guess I won’t, though, because I don’t want to dilute my textwall-draft brand more than necessary and there are a few text posts that I fully intend to post before leaving. Or at least one. Although on second thought, it’s possible they might actually not be as interesting as posts like this one about the adorable me from the past. As Pablo Picasso once said, “Youth has no age.” (Yes, I totally just went on BrainyQuote and searched for “youth”. Forgive me, please.) Oh well.</p>
<p>Today’s throwback theme is old puzzles! Particularly picture ones! In reverse chronological order by last modified time, because I said so! All the image puzzles are puzzlehunty in the sense that you’re supposed to end up with a single word or short phrase as your final answer.</p>
<h3 id="p06pre2">
<code>art/hidd3n/p06pre2.png</code> (2010/10/31)
</h3>
<p><a href="/img/p06pre2.png"><img src="/img/p06pre2.png" alt="p06pre2" width="640" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3210" /></a> A straightforward one to start. I have no idea what’s with the filename, though.</p>
<h3 id="purity2logic">
<code>haxxor/purity2/logic.html</code> (2010/10/10?)
</h3>
<p>My file hierarchy is really weird. I don’t think this time stamp is when I wrote the puzzle because it was part of a silly static site setup I created (but never actually put anywhere), and I probably edited and regenerated stuff like the breadcrumbs many times, but it’ll have to do.</p>
<p>This is also funny because the title of the HTML file is “Logic Puzzles” and the description starts, “These puzzles were made when I was really bored…”, but there’s only one puzzle.</p>

	<p>Mom dug up an old hard drive for me to find photos of my elementary-school self participating in the same math competition I’m presenting at in a week. I discovered a lot of other interesting old stuff there. So today’s filler post image for the <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">streak</a> is courtesy of Brian<sub>2003/03/23</sub>. I don’t think it means anything, but sorry, I really really need to work on that presentation.</p>

	Nope, still no meaningful post today. Instead here is a pretty diagram of the A* search algorithm (A-star in English, for my search crawler overlords). At least, I hope it is; I spent more time fiddling with the pretty colors than making sure the algorithm I implemented was actually A*. It looks right, though? In the background, red component measures traversed distance from start, (inverted) green component measures difference between the traversed distance plus heuristic distance and the theoretically optimal heuristic distance from the start, blue component measures heuristic distance to goal.

	<p>When I first realized it might be helpful to start trying to remember the correspondence between MIT courses and their numbers, I expected a list of mnemonics for this correspondence would be one of those Things That Should Exist On the Internet. I’m pretty surprised it doesn’t. I mean, MIT has, what, <a href="http://web.mit.edu/facts/alum-association.html">at least 100,000 alumni</a>; as far as I know, nearly everybody who goes there speaks the number correspondence fluently, so they have to learn it; and the science of mnemonics has been with us since the ancient Greeks and people who understand its usefulness can’t be uncommon, especially not in such a prestigious institute of higher education.</p>
<p>What gives?</p>
<p>I’m not sure. Maybe it’s just that nobody has posted their mnemonic set on the Internet out of embarrassment? My mnemonics are pretty bad too, but hey, <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law">Cunningham’s Law</a> — if you’re reading, feel free to add better ones in the comments, or to criticize my horribly unenlightened and stereotypical characterizations of your courses, to make this thing better. Or maybe it’s out of concern that nobody else will find it useful? I get that feeling but my <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">streak</a> compels me to ignore it now, as it has for the last dozen posts or so. Or maybe they just didn’t optimize for search engine findability, so I can’t find it? I hope this post fixes that.</p>
<p>Actually, I guess the most likely reason is that maybe most people don’t actually have <em>all</em> the course numbers memorized with perfect recall, only the handful of most common ones they and their friends are in, and it’s perfectly fine to ask for clarification when an unknown number comes up in conversation, so nobody ever feels like they need to bother with mnemonics for every single course. Feels sensible to me.</p>
<p>But anyway, I’m not most people.</p>
<hr />
<p>The most comprehensive resource of courses and numbers, including their history, appears to have once been at <code>http://alumweb.mit.edu/clubs/sandiego/contents_courses.shtml</code>. Many, many links point there. Unfortunately, it is dead and I cannot find its new home, if it has one. Fortunately, there is an <a href="https://archive.is/xViRP">archived version on archive.is</a>; on the other hand, I am not sure whether any updates have occurred since it was archived. A more recent version with course populations from 2005 is <a href="http://web.mit.edu/mollieb/www/blog/MIT%20course%20numbers.html">this chart</a> linked from the MIT Admissions blog post <a href="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/numbers_are_names_too">Numbers are names too</a>.  Speaking of which, I realize that this chart will likely reduce the effectiveness of using course numbers as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth">shibboleth</a>, which the blog post appreciated. But I say if this mnemonic set can reduce the cognitive load of a few other MIT students, so they have more time and more energy to spend on academics and self-actualization and various important things, then it’s worth it. (I don’t care either way. I have fun memorizing weird things.)</p>

	<p><strong>tl;dr: anybody want to add me on Line or tell/remind me about other phone chat apps? betaveros as always.</strong></p>
<p>Wow, talk about uninspired post titles.</p>
<p>I got a new phone today. Or, well, it’s second-hand, actually. I try to make electronics last a long time, but I think this was justified given the state of my last phone’s screen:</p>
<p><a href="/img/screen.jpg"><img src="/img/screen.jpg?w=269" alt="old phone screen, with a visibly malfunctioning black patch" width="269" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3142" /></a></p>
<p>Besides, I’m going off to college and all. Anyway, the phone is pretty cool. It’s a slick shade of red, it came with a cover and everything, and it has one of those fancy 3x3-grid locks. How secure are those again?</p>
<p>Well, we could just <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6979524/android-lock-password-combinations">find the answer on StackOverflow</a>, but that’s boring.</p>

	Okay, I think I’m figuring this out. When I make a filler post for the streak, it should be an unabashed filler post, so I can accumulate some of the blogging time I find each day to work on a serious post (and for doing the other important stuff I should be doing!) instead of wasting it right away.
Life. I’m programming something for Dad involving a parser using Jison, and one of the tasks involved stuffing a custom lexer into the parser.

	Ok I give up I don’t have any material and don’t feel like preparing any because the influx of IMO problems, including the shortlist, is too fascinating. Instead, here is a joke quoted verbatim from TVTropes (CC-NC-SA).
 An American anthropologist has been studying a tribe in Africa by living with them for a year. One day, the chief called him into the chief’s hut. The chief sighed. “Well, my friend, it seems that we must ask you to leave.

<p>She looked down. Yes, they were both Dr. Perkins, she’d know that pair of glasses and spiky hair anywhere.</p>
