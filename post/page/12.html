	<p>I’m going to do it again! I’m going to break a post into parts to milk it for the <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">daily posting streak</a>. Desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>
<p>This is mostly a self-analysis post though.</p>
<p>WARNING: <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TVTropesWillRuinYourVocabulary">This post contains many, many TVTropes links.</a> If you are like me and need to be productive but are <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife">liable to being sucked into TVTropes</a>, maybe you should find a way to commit to not clicking on any of these links, or just stop reading. The <a href="https://xkcd.com/609/">obligatory xkcd</a> is kind of long and also featured on one of the TVTropes links I’ve already made, so I’m not going to embed it.</p>
<p>I <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/fiction">blogged about this before in 2013</a> — how I felt that the analysis trained into me by English class was dulling my ability to appreciate and write the types of fiction I really enjoyed. After thinking about it I realized the mismatch goes deeper than that. Because the things I seek the most in fiction are escapism and entertainment. I like simple fiction with obvious (though maybe not <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">that obvious</a>) <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Aesops</a> and extreme economy of characters via making all the reveals being of the form “X and Y are the same person” (which does not quite seem to be a trope but may be an occurrence of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConnectedAllAlong">Connected All Along</a>, with the most famous subtrope being <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">Luke, I Am Your Father</a> (which is <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">a misquote</a>!), and is also one common <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockEpilepticTrees">Stock Epileptic Tree</a>, so maybe this isn’t the best example), because not only are such reveals fun, they make the plot simpler. What can I say, it works.</p>
<p>The qualities of being thought-provoking or heartwarming are only bonuses for me; needless <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JigsawPuzzlePlot">complexity in the number of characters or plots</a> is a strict negative. Sorry, I don’t want to spend effort trying to remember which person is which and how a hundred different storylines relate to each other if they don’t build to a convincing, cohesive, and <em>awesome</em> <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">Reveal</a>, and often not even then. And I like closure, so I feel pretty miserable when writers <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">resolve a long-awaited plot point just to add a bunch more</a>. Because of this I am ambivalent about long book series; most of my favorite works of fiction have come in long series but starting a new one always gives me <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommitmentAnxiety">Commitment Anxiety</a>. Even when there’s closure, when I finish an immersive movie or book I’m always left kind of disoriented, like I’ve just been lifted out of a deep pool and have to readjust to breathing and seeing the world from the perspective of a normal person on land. I like when I’m reading good fiction, but I don’t like going through withdrawal symptoms. If I want to read complicated open-ended events, I’ll go read a history textbook, because at least the trivia might come up useful some day; if I want tough problems I’ll just look at real life and think about the possibility of college debt and having to find a job and everything. (If it wasn’t obvious yet, this is why I hyperbolically hate on <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> often.) Even worse than all of this is multiple paragraphs full of scenery and nothing else, unless of course parts or maybe all of the scenery are <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov’s Guns</a>.</p>
<p>Some part of me is embarrassed to admit this because I’ve been educated for so long about deep literature that makes social commentary or reveals an inner evil of humanity or whatever. But then again, I don’t really need an education to appreciate the simple, fun fiction I apparently do.</p>
<p>So: there are a lot of famous classics or mainstream works I can’t really enjoy too much, or in some cases, at all. And yet, sometimes a random story or webcomic will appear and I just won’t be able to stop reading. Why? I decided to try making a list of things I like in fiction:</p>

	<p>20 posts so far in my <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment" />daily streak</a>, ignoring the time I posted after midnight but including exactly one of this post and the commitment-starting post. You pick which one. The arithmetic works out either way. My last four posts have been made with less than two minutes to spare before midnight, and my last post in particular made it by just seven seconds. This is working as intended in that I’ve knocked out nine drafts that I’m pretty sure would have rotted in my draft folder for at least a few more months otherwise, and I’ve also jotted down more spontaneous thoughts and posted them instead of postponing them until they was too late to be applicable. But this is also a problem because I can’t spend every day procrastinating blogging and then frantically blogging before midnight — I have some serious programming work to do, and a talk to prepare for, and, of course, linear algebra homework!!!</p>
<p>I’m kind of stuck here so</p>

	<p>If you remember, <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/quixotic-1">Part 1 was here</a> and my goal is to construct a theoretical system of standardized tests that I would be satisfied by. Here’s what I’ve got. As usual, because of the <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">daily posting streak I have openly committed to</a>, standard disclaimers apply.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We’d have a first-tier test like the SAT, except this will be <em>explicitly designed</em> <strong>not</strong> to distinguish among the high performers.</p>
<p>The goal of the test is to assess <em>basic</em> proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics. Nothing else. Most good students, those who have a shot at “good colleges” and know it, will be able to ace this test with minimal effort and can spend their time studying for other things or engaging in other pursuits. Students who don’t will still have to study and it will probably be boring, but the hope is that, especially if you’re motivated to get into a good college, there won’t be much of that studying.</p>
<p>For colleges, the intention of this test is to allow them to require this test score from everybody without having to <a href="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-difficulty-with-data">put up disclaimers</a> that go like,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there is really not a difference in our process between someone who scores, say, a 740 on the SAT math, and someone who scores an 800 on the SAT math. So why, as the commentor asks, is there such a difference in the admit rate? <em>Aha! Clearly we DO prefer higher SAT scores!</em></p>
Well no, we don’t. What we prefer are things which <em>may coincide</em> with higher SAT scores…

	<p>(Disjointed blog content, posted as part of a <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">daily posting streak I have openly committed to</a>; standard disclaimers apply)</p>
<p>Blogging is weird. I’m still nervous when I post stuff because I’m concerned I’m wrong, and end up looking unprofessional or attracting a bunch of Cueballs or something.</p>
<p><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png" alt="xkcd" /></p>
<p>Before I told people about this blog, during the time when 100% of its traffic came from its coincidental placement in search results, I didn’t have to worry about this. Now, I choose my words. Because some Important Person™ might show up. Maybe even misinterpret something I said and/or get furiously offended at a badly phrased joke.</p>
<p>I also fear that I’ll update my beliefs quickly; maybe I’ll change my mind or discover a much better argument for the other side really soon. But the blog post would still be there, displaying my old belief, giving the reader an inaccurate or misleading impression of myself. People might even chat with me to argue about it, and then I have to <em>admit I’m wrong oh no!</em> It feels a lot better admitting I’m wrong on my own turf, in my own time.</p>
<p>This passage from <cite>Lord of the Flies</cite> comes to mind (I had hurriedly reread the book as ammunition for the AP Literature test and noticed that my past self had marked it):</p>

	<p>It is more than slightly intimidating to go into the room through the big sliding door and see everybody dressed up in full-on green surgical garb with masks and hair nets. I don’t remember this part. Feeling a little vulnerable, I change my clothes.</p>
<p>I ask to listen to my iPod during the operation — I remember being able to do this during the operation four long years ago when the subject of today’s surgery was inserted into my shoulder — but the nurse(?) says it’s best not to do that because they’ll be using something electric to stop the blood. Instead I can listen to music played from a computer in the operating room. Well, okay then.</p>
<p>She escorts me through a bunch of twisty little passages to said room. The computer is a dual-screen Windows XP. The nurse shows me that there is a folder with random albums sorted by year. I poke through the folders and create a playlist in Windows Media Player interleaving <cite>1989</cite> with a collection of classics from 五月天(Mayday). Then I get on the operating table and wait. One of the nurses compliments me on my choice of the latter band. A few tracks later, I deduce that my interleaving had been to no avail because the media player was set to shuffle. I spend a lot of time on the operating table at first not doing anything except stare at the ceiling. There is a white three-legged contraption there, with each hinged limb ending in a large blue-rimmed circle of surgical lights. There are white sans-serif letters inscribed on the rims, saying Chromophare® E 668 and Berch-something. I think the “something” was a synonym for “say” or “tell”. An after-the-fact search says it’s Berchtold. Typical human memory.</p>
<p>Later I am covered with lots of green cloth, which blocks out the ceiling. Instead, I can only see a clipboard and random paper forms on the left side of my peripheral vision, presumably propping up the cloth. The clipboard is a highly translucent pink. The form on top is yellow and has a box saying something about somebody paying; the form on bottom is white with a black-and-pink-striped right border. The clipboard’s clip also has random streaks of black marker across a white sticker.</p>
<p>Music plays.</p>

	<p>Life update: I got my driver’s license from the place where I learned to drive. Then I drove home from there with my mom, and it was zarking <em>terrifying</em>.</p>
<p>Also, WordPress says it has protected my blog from 3<sup>8</sup> spam comments.</p>
<p>Early in the morning tomorrow, I have a small surgical operation, so I can’t sleep too late. (Well, it ended up being pretty late anyway. Darn.) Therefore I think I’m going to do something unprecedented on this blog for the <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">daily posting streak</a>: I’m going to post an incomplete non-expository post.</p>
<p>Yes, the only purpose of the title is to get initials that are four consecutive letters of the alphabet..</p>
<hr />
<p>One of the more argumentative post sequences on my blog involved ranting against standardized tests.</p>
<p>My very first stab was probably the <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/test">silly satire</a> directed at the test everybody has to take that takes up two hours per day of an entire week. Once college became a thing in my life, I wrote a <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/2400">humblebrag rant</a> after I took the SAT and then a <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/sat">summary post</a> after I snagged this subject for an English class research paper and finished said paper.</p>
<p>It should be plenty clear that I am not ranting against this part of the system because it’s disadvantageous to me.</p>
<p>But it should also be said that I’ve read some convincing arguments for using standardized tests <em>more</em> in college admissions (<a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119321/harvard-ivy-league-should-judge-students-standardized-tests">Pinker</a>, then <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2003">Aaronson</a>). Despite the imperfections of tests, they argue, the alternatives are likely to be less fair and more easily gamed. The fear that selecting only high test-scorers will yield a class of one-dimensional boring thinkers is unfounded. And the idea that standardized tests “reduce a human being to a number” may be uncomfortable for some, but it makes no sense to prioritize avoiding a vague feeling of discomfort over trusting reliable social science studies. Neither article, you will note, advocates selecting <em>all</em> of one’s college admits based on highest score. Just a certain unspecified proportion, one that’s probably a lot larger than it is today.</p>
<p>And although I wish the first article linked its studies, I mostly agree with their arguments. So this puts me in a tricky position. These positions I’ve expressed seem hard to reconcile! So, after arguing about all this with a friend who told me things like</p>
<blockquote>
I think you fail to understand how anti-intellectual american society is
</blockquote>
<p>(comments on this statement are also welcome) I think some clarifications and updates on how I feel are in order.</p>

	<p>(Part of a <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">daily posting streak</a> but for once I don’t think I need to apply the disclaimers to this. If you thought for even one second that the title was a palindrome, I’ve succeeded. It’s not. I don’t have a good title. Okay, maybe slap the disclaimers onto that part.)</p>
<p>The first time I drove a car was on 5/18. I think. I might be off by a day or so. Most of that day’s lesson was spent learning to go forward and backward, accelerate and decelerate smoothly, and turn the wheel without getting my hands tangled up. My coach made me count out loud how many circles I was turning: 一圈半圈半圈一圈etc. It felt kind of stupid when I was doing it, but I guess in the end it helped, and eventually once I got the hang of turning the wheel, I just subvocalized it and my coach also tacitly stopped bothering me about it.</p>
<p>The first time I activated a turn signal light was probably on 5/26. That was the day I wrote in my TIL log that, when you turn the steering wheel back from the direction you were turning, the turn signal lights turn off automatically. After you think about it, this is a pretty sensible thing for turn signal lights to do, but when I first learned this my mind was utterly blown. Wow!</p>
<p>It’s like when you’re turning and you turn on the turn signal and it starts clicking this steady beat to increase the dramatic tension, like you’re doing a trick in a sports driving game and you have to quickly hit the right sequence of buttons on the controller. Then you actually turn the corner and then turn the wheel back, and as the wheel makes its smooth sliding sound back to its upright position, the beat stops like a resounding V7 to I resolution, as if to congratulate you on executing a beautiful turn without crashing into another car or driving off the side of the road.</p>
<p>That’s what it feels like, anyway.</p>
<p>On slow days, when you’re halfway through a turn but the drivers ahead of you are waiting in a queue that stretches on forever on the practice track, you can shift to the parking gear and use the turn signal’s beat as a metronome and sing along to it too. I do.</p>
<p>Or, of course, there’s the obligatory xkcd:</p>

	<p>That’s the name of the text file that comes up in MacVim when I hit <kbd>option-shift-Z</kbd>. I use it for quick notes and editing stuff to later be pasted into webpage forms, especially complicated JavaScripty ones (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) that don’t play nice with Pentadactyl’s popout editor functionality. The keyboard shortcut is set in <a href="http://qsapp.com/">Quicksilver</a>, although I was doing something similar even on Windows with AutoHotKey.</p>
<p>Over time I tend to hoard stuff here. Vim says it has more than 40,000 words and 300,000 characters. It contains seeds that never grow into blog posts, planned tweets I later abandon out of embarrassment, preemptively composed comments that never get posted, carefully written text I’m paranoid might get deleted by the Internet, and more. For today’s frivolous post (part of a <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">daily post streak</a>, standard disclaimers apply, etc.), here are some excerpted context-free highlights, like a personal extended game of “What’s in your Ctrl+V right now?”. The task of interpretation and/or guessing the context is left up to the reader. Have fun! See you tomorrow!</p>
