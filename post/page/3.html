	<p>I finally did it.</p>
<p>I was on-site for the 2016 MIT Mystery Hunt. I even <em>solved a metapuzzle</em>. This year I hunted with ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈, the team primarily but not overwhelmingly formed from floorpi, my dorm floor. (Perhaps somewhat regrettably, I didn’t contribute to any events or runarounds or things given to HQ, unless you count attending a “recitation” for Student Simulator (round King Arthur, second from left).)</p>
<p>(Also, I made this post. Has it been two weeks already? Okay, that’s not an unusual timeframe.)</p>
<p>But wow, I got to touch so many puzzles.</p>
<p>Non-spoilery comments on particularly memorable puzzles I did, which are disproportionately programming-related, if anybody wants to look at them (I am describing how to get to the puzzle from the round instead of linking because I’m lazy and links might rot but the instructions will hopefully survive archival (although turns out there’s actually a <a href="http://huntception.com/toc.html">table of contents</a> so I don’t know what I’m doing)):</p>

	<p>I wasn’t sure what would be the right song for 2015 until I set foot on MIT. Then it was a no-brainer.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KThlYHfIVa8" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
 </div>

<p>Where do I even begin?</p>
<ul>
<li>
I thought cooking was hard. Then I ended up in the kitchen on the third floor of the west parallel of East Campus and had to produce something edible. So I figured out how to acquire chicken and put it in a pan with some onions and heat the whole thing up. It wasn’t even that bad! A few weeks later, I graduated to cooking in a rotation for six people. All this from a guy whose culinary abilities only went as far as frying eggs a few months ago. It’s incredible where life takes you sometimes.
</li>
<li>
I thought I couldn’t productively listen to lyrical music while doing homework, because I get distracted and/or bogged down by the feels. Turns out there’s a category of metal songs with great atmosphere and terrible lyrics that does the trick.
</li>
<li>
I had planned to suffer through introductory chemistry my freshman fall and introductory biology my freshman spring, and thereafter be done with required classes. Well, I took chemistry, but there was barely any suffering involved, and now biology fits nowhere on my freshman spring schedule.
</li>
<li>
<p>I had some outlandish hopes I’d walk into college and be able to become mildly financially independent because people would throw high-paying jobs at me that I could learn from, but I didn’t expect it to happen. Life isn’t <em>that</em> easy!</p>
Well… it happened.
</li>
<li>
<p>An <em>incredible</em> number of redacted things.</p>
<p>I’ve never been that kind of guy. Honest and innocent to a fault, no secrets except those arising from paranoid self-assigned concern about others’ privacy: that’s me. Until this year.</p>
<p>Oh well, I can’t blog about it.</p>
[redacted]
</li>
<li>
<p>But mostly, of course, I actually graduated. The teacher-appreciation dinner happened (6/4), where I debuted my graduation song (woo!) and ate some good cake (double woo!); senior prom happened (6/7), with some awesome photos; and then, actually, the graduation ceremony. (6/10, same day I realized I had recently passed 100 starred things on GitHub.)</p>
<p>::looks at self:: I’m actually a college student now.</p>
<p>Every one of these stages of life seems like it should be a big deal, like I should pass through and suddenly know all the things about maturity and aspirations and life that are expected of college students, but it never happens that way.</p>
At least, all things considered, I think this transition was very successful at taking my mind off the angsty side of things. This post is actually surprisingly unangsty. Sorry to disappoint if that’s what you’re here for!

	<p>My inner perfectionist is crying that I have to post this, in particular over my pathetic <a href="http://snowclones.org/2007/05/22/x-y-and-z-oh-my/">snowclone</a> title, but my inner pragmatist knows that, judging by my old blogging patterns, it’s now or never.</p>
<p>18.06: 56%, haven’t touched it in a while, but I think I can do lots more on the plane.</p>
<hr />
<p>As a non-contestant, I confess I feel totally uninvested in the results and find the Closing Ceremony boring. All contestants go up, country by country, and have their awards read off. No effort is made to make any sort of buildup to a climax. But maybe this is for the best; we don’t want anybody feeling shafted or discouraged from continuing to do math due to a mere elementary-/middle-school competition. Meanwhile, though, I’m browsing reddit on my phone.</p>
<p>After this ceremony, the entire Taiwan delegation spends some time walking around outside while the guides make confused phone calls trying to decide where we eat lunch. My parents offer me some potato chips they bought somewhere, which are (as the label is really eager to point out) baked, not fried. Some time passes this way; eventually, the guides figure it out and we go through amazingly long queues to eat at the cafeteria, as usual. Then we are sent to a massive shopping mall for the afternoon, a place so large that its exits have number labels that go up into the double digits so that people don’t get lost.</p>
<p>I take trippy failed panorama photos from the bus windows. <a href="/img/trippy-panorama.jpg"><img src="/img/trippy-panorama.jpg?w=652" alt="[trippy panorama of a shopping mall]" width="652" height="427" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3321" /></a>  The exit our group is supposed to use and remember is number 9. However, since just about everybody else from the competition is clustered around that exit, we choose to enter through a neighboring one, which is somewhat surprisingly numbered 5.</p>

	<p>(Nontopical life update: Current 18.06 homework status: 34% (mildly screwed, probably won’t finish before I leave my cozy home for the U.S. and I usually struggle to get into the mood for homework while traveling, but I guess I’ll have to)) <a href="/img/18-06-1.png"><img src="/img/18-06-1.png?w=296" alt="[18.06 status panel: 34%]" /></a> (I’ve been spending most of my uptime doing said homework and running errands, and my downtime catching up on <cite>Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</cite> while farming the Flight Rising Coliseum.

<h3 id="day-3-excursions">
Day 3 (Excursions)
</h3>
<p>Morning routine snipped. We come to the middle school again to eat breakfast and gather; the contestants will be taking their tests here (accompanied by one bottle of “Buff” energy drink each) while the rest of us will be going on an excursion. Before this happens, though, two Taiwanese contestants ask me and Hsin-Po some math problems. There’s a geometry problem, which I fail to solve:</p>
<blockquote>
(paraphrased) In triangle △ABC, ∠A is 40° and ∠B is 60°. The angle bisector of ∠A meets BC at D; E is on AB such that ∠ADE is 30°. Find ∠DEC.
</blockquote>
<p>Hsin-Po figures out that, once you guess (ROT13) gur bgure boivbhf privna vf nyfb na natyr ovfrpgbe naq gurl vagrefrpg ng gur vapragre, lbh pna cebir vg ol pbafgehpgvat gur vapragre naq fubjvat sebz gur tvira natyr gung gurl vaqrrq pbvapvqr.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Then, there’s a combinatorics problem in a book with a solution that they’re not sure about:</p>
<blockquote>
(paraphrased) 15 rays starting at the same point are drawn. What is the maximum number of pairs of rays that form obtuse angles?
</blockquote>
<p>This happens really close to the test starts and although I have this feeling it’s isomorphic to a notable combinatorial problem, I don’t manage to articulate the isomorphism until it’s too late and they have to go. Indeed, this is more or less equivalent to (ROT13) Ghena: gur tencu unf ab sbhe-pyvdhr naq n pbzcyrgr guerr-cnegvgr tencu vf pbafgehpgvoyr. After thinking though the solution on their book, though, I realize I’ve never seen this proof of said theorem before! (But later I realize it’s actually the just very first proof that <cite>Proofs from the BOOK</cite> offers. I probably skipped it because it involved induction as well as some algebraic manipulations that looked much less intuitive and natural than they really were, so it didn’t look as cool as the later proofs. Oooooops.)</p>
<p>I suspect I wouldn’t do too well if I had to participate in that contest right then. But anyway, excursion.</p>
<p>After a long bus ride, we arrive at our first destination, Jingyuetan (淨月潭 lit. Clear Moon Lake<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>), allegedly the sister lake to Taiwan’s own famous<sup>[citation needed]</sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Moon_Lake">Sun Moon Lake</a>. We tour the place on a wall-less car and look at the lake and lots of trees. During a stop, I take some pictures of sunflowers and bees, as well as a stand selling Taiwanese sausages.</p>
<p><a href="/img/lake-1.jpg"><img src="/img/lake-1.jpg?w=652" alt="[Lake and ferry]" width="652" height="369" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3294" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/img/lake-2.jpg"><img src="/img/lake-2.jpg?w=652" width="652" height="369" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3295" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/img/bee.jpg"><img src="/img/bee.jpg?w=170" alt="[Bee and sunflower]" width="170" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3296" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/img/sausages.jpg"><img src="/img/sausages.jpg?w=652" alt="[Sausages advertised as from Taiwan!]" width="652" height="369" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3297" /></a></p>
<p>The car blares weird music during the tour, such as a version of Für Elise with all the accents on different beats and a disjointed remix of the viral Chinese song <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E5%B0%8F%E8%8B%B9%E6%9E%9C_%28%E6%AD%8C%E6%9B%B2%29">小蘋果</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Apple_%28song%29">Little Apple</a>)<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> with two other Chinese songs, connected with mumbling English rap segues. We also eat boxed lunches here while sitting on tiny, cramped foam mattresses on the dirt floor.</p>
<p>Our next stop is a museum, where there are lots of ancient historical artifacts I’m not very interested in. I find a collection of certificates involving or quoting Chairman Mao more intriguing:  <a href="/img/mao.jpg"><img src="/img/mao.jpg?w=652" alt="[Certificates with quotes and/or pictures of Chairman Mao]" width="652" height="369" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3298" /></a></p>

	<p>We get up at 3:40 AM. By 4 AM we have left our house, speeding like a bullet into the dark.</p>
<hr />
<p>(Ohai. Somehow it slipped my mind that I was ending my streak by leaving the country for a competition that would likely be highly bloggable, like my last two international olympiads, both of which led to notable post sequences on this blog. (Admittedly, the first one was never really completed…) My only excuse was that I was worried I might not be able to access my blog from inside the Great Firewall, but I did (via vpn.mit.edu) and even if I hadn’t, I could still have drafted posts locally in Markdown as I usually do, so I don’t know what I was thinking.)</p>
<p>(Also: because, as I’ve said way too many times recently, I need to do linear algebra homework, these posts aren’t going to be as complete or as perfect as I’d like them to be. Although I’m probably just saying this to persuade myself; I tend to include many of the boring parts as well as the interesting parts of the trip, which maybe benefits my future self at the expense of other readers. I probably need to get out of this habit more if I want to blog for a wider audience, though. Oh well.)</p>
<h3 id="backstory">
Backstory
</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.imc-official.org/">International Mathematics Competition</a> (IMC) is, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">as it says</a>, an international mathematics competition. But I should add that it is for elementary and middle-school students (in other words, I am not competing, okay??). (edit: Also, one or two letters are often prefixed to indicate the host country, for whatever reason. This year it would be CIMC, C for China.) I am tagging along because I am a student of Dr. Sun, one of the chief organizers, and have been slotted to give a talk and possibly help with grading the papers and translating. My father is coming to help arrange a side event, a <a href="http://dominosolver.com/">domino puzzle game</a> competition, which he programmed the system for; and my mom and sister are also coming to help with translation and other duties. Other people in our group: Dr. Sun himself, his longtime assistant slash fellow teacher Mr. Li (wow I’m sorry I forgot you while first writing this), my friend and fellow math student Hsin-Po, who is an expert at making polyhedra from origami or binder clips (and at Deemo); Chin-Ling, my father’s student/employee who also programmed lots of the domino puzzle server and possesses a professional camera; and, of course, all the elementary- and middle-school contestants, as well as most of their parents.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ve ever given this amount of background exposition about any event I’ve attended to my not-so-imaginary audience before. It feels weird. Some part of me is worried about breaking these people’s privacy by posting this, which makes a little bit of sense but not enough for me to think that it’s actually a valid reason to avoid or procrastinate blogging. I think it’s a rationalization.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<h3 id="day-1">
Day 1
</h3>
<p>The only interesting thing that happens at the airport is a short loud argument in the queues for luggage check-in, perhaps partly fueled by our high number of people and of heavy boxes (gifts for other countries and raw materials for Hsin-Po’s polyhedra). I don’t know whose fault it is.</p>
<p>In case I fail to scale the firewall, I attempt to download Facebook on my phone for one last look before boarding, but it fails during installation twice and I give up.</p>
<p>Our plane is not fancy enough to offer personal screens and entertainment centers for everybody, but thankfully the ride lasts only three hours, so this is tolerable. Instead, the plane plays the second <cite>Divergence</cite> movie on overhead screens, which I watch half-heartedly. The plot setup seems interesting but the ending seems to me to involve two Ass Pulls™, although since I haven’t been paying much attention I am not confident if I just missed some foreshadowing or character development. On the flight, I also read the proof of the irrationality of powers of <i>e</i> in <cite>Proofs from THE BOOK</cite> and leaf through the magazines.</p>
<p>I don’t hear any good music on-board, except maybe “Space Oddity”, which is a little freaky to be listening to while cruising at so may kilometers in the sky. Perhaps because of this, I find myself singing and humming “Space Oddity” unexpectedly often over the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="arrival">
Arrival
</h3>
<p>The very first sign we see after alighting the plane consists entirely of characters that are the same in Simplified and Traditional Chinese — if I remember correctly, 「前有坡道，小心慢走」<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The Changchun airport looks like any other airport, coolly blue-themed with moving platforms. The restrooms have fancy bright purple soap. Even though I consciously think about how I have suddenly arrived in a country that places notable restrictions on freedom of speech and Internet access, I don’t feel it. Eep, what an anticlimax.</p>

	<p>I made it!</p>
<p>After a <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/rekt">misstep on the fourth day</a> I managed to post one post every day, completing the rest of the <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">streak</a>! This post is scheduled to go out around the time my plane takes off.</p>
<p>I’m free!</p>
<p>I’d insert a <cite>Frozen</cite> gif here if I could find a good one, but I don’t like any of the ones I found and besides, copyright is an issue. So instead:</p>

<p>IMO2007.C6. In a mathematical competition some competitors are friends. Friendship is always mutual. Call a group of competitors a clique if each two of them are friends. (In particular, any group of fewer than two competitiors is a clique.) The number of members of a clique is called its size.</p>
<p>Given that, in this competition, the largest size of a clique is even, prove that the competitors can be arranged into two rooms such that the largest size of a clique contained in one room is the same as the largest size of a clique contained in the other room.</p>

<p>If you remember where I first posted this to break a combo, you have an excellent memory and/or spend too much time stalking me. If you remember the <em>context</em> under which I posted this to break a combo, you have a better memory than I do.</p>
<p>Was my streak a success? On the bright side, I definitely generated lots of posts, many of which were radical departures from my old blogging habits:</p>
