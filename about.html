	<article class="content"><p>Hi there. I’m Brian, online handle <code>betaveros</code>, and this is a blog where I post just about anything. I used to introduce myself at length here, but now that I have a real website let’s just talk about this blog. I always used to describe it by saying I post a lot of “random stuff”, and many other people describe their blogs that way too, but after a while (like, a few years?) I realized this is a cop-out from <em>actually</em> trying to describe the content of blog, not to mention overselling my ability to generate true randomness. On a good day I can maybe score 65% on the <a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nick/aaronson-oracle/">Aaronson Oracle</a> (where 50% is perfectly random and 100% is completely predictable).</p>

I'm so random.&quot; &quot;Yeah, me too.&quot;" srcset="//imgs.xkcd.com/comics/im_so_random_2x.png 2x">

<p>I like mathematics and computer science, so I post about these topics. That’s where the blog name comes from: “Bounded-error” is the B of the complexity class <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BPP_%28complexity%29">BPP</a>, the class of decision problems solvable by a randomized Turing machine (with probability bounded away from 1/2), and “Log” is the inverse of the exponential function. I also record things about my life here; you can naturally interpret “Log” as a list of records, the same meaning that gave us the word “blog” in the first place. Sometimes I am counterproductively perfectionist about my posts, so taken literally, the title is also a reminder to myself that it’s okay to make and publish mistakes sometimes. (If you spot any mistakes, please let me know.)</p>
<p>Oh yeah, there are also puzzles.</p>
<h3 id="puzzles">Puzzles</h3>
<p>I’ve made and posted a couple grid-based logic puzzles and a handful of puzzlehunt puzzles on this blog, but haven’t found much time or inspiration recently.</p>
<p>Instructions are generally on top of the post, sometimes with external links. I post a lot more mutants and hybrids than classic types, though, so many puzzles are one-of-a-kind. If you’re new to them, Sudoku is the classic classic logic puzzle type — all the rules are different but I think solving these puzzles involves the same kind of mindset.</p>
<p><a href="//blog.vero.site/post/puzzle-43">Puzzle 43 / Fillomino [Nonrectangular + Walls]</a> (not too hard once you get the hang of it) is probably my favorite, followed perhaps by <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/puzzle-45">Puzzle 45 / Fillomino [No-Path]</a> and <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/puzzle-31">Puzzle 31 / Fillomino [Sashigane]</a>, which are both harder. I guess Fillominoes are pretty awesome because you can slap whatever you want onto them and get a fun variant.</p>
<p>These images are made with my own program for the purpose, <a href="https://github.com/betaveros/gridderface">Gridderface</a>. It’s written in Scala and is open-source on GitHub with some hopefully usable documentation. Also, if you use Paint, you can do Slitherlinks and variants with a flood-fill tool; try it and see.</p>
<h3 id="blog-history">Blog History</h3>
<p>I started blogging in fourth grade. My blog has suffered through four-and-a-half revivals and two platform migrations, and I’ve deleted a lot of the old posts, so I’m not even sure if I can count it as the same blog any more. Kind of a Ship of Theseus deal.</p>
<ul>
<li>2006, September to November: Blogs sound cool in theory but not in practice — I mostly post a bunch of boring descriptions of each school day (albeit with the tone of an excited fourth grader).</li>
<li>2008, February: Roughly the same thing happens again.</li>
<li>2010, April to August: A long sequence of vaguely depressed philosophical and futuristic rambling.</li>
<li>2011, August: Long rant that doesn’t feel right on Facebook leads to posts about self-analysis and personality flaws which inexplicably segue into the current randomness.</li>
<li>2011, November: To make things more confusing, I start posting logic puzzles because all my friends are doing it, neatly alongside all the other teenage-angsty posts.</li>
<li>2012, February: I migrate this blog from Blogger to WordPress for some not-particularly-inspired reason.</li>
<li>2017, November: After my posting activity slowly ground to a halt, I migrate this blog onto <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, the static site generator, and GitHub Pages + CloudFlare.</li>
</ul>
