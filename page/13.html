	<p>This is another <a href="https://mellowmelon.wordpress.com/double-back/">MellowMelon’s Double Back</a>. Briefly, draw a closed loop through all square centers visiting each bold-outlined area twice. Shaded cells do not influence solving, only aesthetics.</p>
<p>It’s mostly easy, I think. It’s okay if you don’t know what the theme means. (Yes, chao, I want more contrib points.) Also, WordPress seems to have stopped automatically linking images to their files. Hmm.</p>

	<p>It’s been a while, hasn’t it? This is something I constructed semi-experimentally to stop failing at an entire genre of puzzles, and then procrastinated posting just about forever. I only test-solved this on paper; I hope I didn’t do anything silly while digitizing.</p>
<p>Rules paraphrased from USPC because I can’t find any good links: Write each of the given words into its own snail; letters must be entered from the outside of the snail spirally inward. Not all squares will be used; squares with “-” must stay blank. Each letter can appear at most once in each row and column.</p>

	<p>Okay I don’t actually know how this pointless rambling got so long. I know the longer it is the more people will just tend to skim, because I do that all the time. So I went back and refactored—er, rewrote all the somewhat tangential bits (wow these puns are too easy) into footnotes. Manually. Obviously if I have to do this again I’ll write a script for it. But the post is still really long, and I bet nobody will read the whole thing. Oh well.</p>
<p>Life updates: I got out of the hospital Friday two-and-a-half weeks ago, went to the preliminaries of NPSC (a national team programming contest) with classmates, threw up a lot, went back into the hospital, and came out again. I wrote a lot of stuff about the experience and how much it sucked (hint: <em>a lot</em>) when I started this draft around that time, but now putting so much detail in this post feels weird. I’m mostly good now.</p>
<p>Three years ago NPSC was the only programming contest I really knew of; now I’ve participated in quite a few more, both online and locally, but it’s still the only contest I’ve entered that gives you real-time verdicts. I believe it inherits this from being modeled after ACM-ICPC, but that’s for college people and I’m less clear on how it works. All the other contests, namely <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/">TopCoder</a>, <a href="http://www.codeforces.com/">CodeForces</a>, <a href="http://usaco.org/">USACO</a>, and the other local individual competition (there doesn’t appear to be an English name so for the purpose of this post I’ll just call it “Nameless Local”; there’s a nation-wide competition in one-and-a-half weeks!), have system tests after the contest that don’t allow you to resubmit afterwards.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> They all give pretests that you get to know about right away, just to catch super-silly non-algorithmic mistakes like failing to remove the debug statements or reading input from the wrong place, but these contain weak test cases and don’t guarantee that the solution will pass the system tests and get full score.  After roughly parsing the rules on the IOI’s website, I believe the IOI (at least this year; I don’t know if it has evolved or anything) allows real-time testing and feedback with a confusing bunch of restrictions: how it apparently works is there are free “public tests”, and you can get results for a “release test” using the official test cases by using a “release token”, which you get two of every half hour. Additionally, there is apparently a cap of 64 submissions per problem, but I’m pretty sure it’s the kind of cap that honest competitors can safely ignore, like the 100-per-group in Australian puzzlehunts. Well, at least it tells us the organizers think in binary. Or octal.</p>

	Okay, I give up. Here it is: Gridderface is a (quoting the project description, which I wrote anyway so whatever) “keyboard inferface for marking grid-based puzzles in Java” that I’ve been working on for too long. It is open-source under the GPL v3.
Basically, it’s a thing you can paste logic puzzle images into to solve them in, like people do in Paint, when you can’t or don’t want to print them.

	<p>Noticed this at <a href="http://meanderlawn.blogspot.tw/">meander lawn</a> who has a really broad puzzle blogroll… I don’t really know what I’m doing and may have misinterpreted something, but here goes. (Ahahaha puzzle 33 on 11/22… I wish it was intentional :P)</p>
<p>Draw a path through square centers which enters and exits through the given places. Outside the “ice barns” (the gray things), the path may turn freely but may not self-intersect; inside “ice barns” the path may self-intersect but may not turn. Each ice barn (not necessarily every cell but every region, I think) must be passed over. The path must pass through each given arrow in the given direction.</p>

	<p>Yes, a “big” crazy mutant puzzle for a “milestone” <a href="https://xkcd.com/1000/">(as seen on xkcd)</a>, both for this blog and for my life. Things are rough now, but I prepared this ridiculously ahead of time. It’s still not <em>really</em> big, but I’m not so experienced and I don’t have the inspiration for something like <a href="http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=535&amp;t=506208">an entire mini-puzzlehunt</a>. Also, I think I should attempt more word-bank-based puzzles some day so I won’t fail as completely at them.</p>
<p>But anyway: This is a Slitherlink combining MellowMelon’s <a href="https://mellowmelon.wordpress.com/slitherlink/crosslink/">Crosslink</a> and <a href="https://mellowmelon.wordpress.com/category/puzzle-types/slitherlink/liar-slitherlink/">Liar</a> variations. Draw a loop through vertices that can intersect itself but must go straight both times if it does; each number normally indicates how many of the four edges around it are draw, but exactly one clue in each row and column is false. Have fun.</p>

	<p>This is a <a href="http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/fillomino.html">Fillomino</a> puzzle where every polyomino is required to be an L-shape, as in <a href="http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/sashigane.html">Sashigane</a>. Write a number in every empty cell so that every group of cells with the same number that is connected through its edges is an L-shape (with arms of positive length and 1-cell thickness) with that number of cells.</p>
<p>My second, and now symmetric, attempt at this crazy self-invented mutant; <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/puzzle-22">puzzle 22</a> was the first. A word of warning: I can’t solve this without bifurcating near the end, so logic purists may be disappointed, but I like the clue arrangement too much. In fact I suspect this puzzle could have many more clues removed without affecting uniqueness, so tight are the rule constraints in this type.</p>

	<p>Haha, way-overdue <a href="http://logicmastersindia.com/FF2/">Fillomino-Fillia</a> practice puzzle. This is a <a href="http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/fillomino.html">Fillomino</a> puzzle; in addition to normal rules, treat numbers inside the grid as building heights. Numbers outside the grid indicate how many buildings can be seen from that direction, where a building blocks all buildings of lower or equal height behind it.</p>
<p>Edit: I should warn that the arithmetic here is pretty annoying.</p>

	<p>Okay did I mention how I sucked at the command line? This is part of the journey towards stopping. Yes, I’m on a Mac and it’s not very *nix-y in some ways but it’s enough for me for now.</p>
<p>Today’s story starts when I learned about <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/"><code>gdb</code></a>, the pure-command-line GNU Debugger, which is incredibly cool. I have tried and failed to learn how to use the debug function on many of my IDEs; I found shotgunning <code>printf</code> statements as needed faster. This may well be the first time I found a command-line tool so much more intuitive than the GUI-equipped programs. Wow.</p>
