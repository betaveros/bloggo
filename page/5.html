<p>I was pretty torn between this and “The Future Soon” as the Year-End Song on this blog, but in the end I think I feel more threatened by the bland existence of the soulless adult than inspired by the starry-eyed-idealism-with-misogynist-undertones of the twelve-year-old, plus I get to show you the best kinetic typography video I have ever seen.</p>
<p>Halfway through 2018 I thought this would be the year of ephemeral phases. I felt like I went through a different phase every month — <a href="https://dominion.games/">Online Dominion</a> in April, crosswords in June, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Connect">Only Connect</a> in July, <a href="https://www.jonathancoulton.com/">Jonathan Coulton</a> in August, a brief stint of trying really hard to barre my guitar chords in October. Somewhere in the middle, I discovered Kittens Game (“the Dark Souls of Incremental Gaming”) and my summer internship mentor got me to pick up Pokémon Go again. A few intense periods of typographical study were interspersed, which involved watching the above music video dozens of times, teaching a Splash class on typography, and developing a new awareness of how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenir_%28typeface%29">Avenir</a> was <em>everywhere</em>. During the last month, I went hard on <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> and got second place, apparently the only person to make it on every single leaderboard. I also did a related <a href="https://kara71.github.io/Advent-of-Golf-2018/">golf side contest</a> and poured a couple more hours into <a href="https://github.com/betaveros/paradoc">Paradoc</a>, my personal golfing language, for rather unclear gain. At least I got a lot of GitHub followers?</p>
<p>It would turn out, though, that a lot of these phases had more staying power than I expected. Pokémon Go is a much better game than it was two years ago and has actually fostered a significant real-life community, which seems like one of the best possible outcomes of an augmented reality game, and I’ve found a steady pace to play at. I spread the Only Connect bug and people on my hall, intrigued by the format but annoyed by the overwhelmingly British trivia<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, started writing and hosting full games for each other, with our own MIT-slanted set of trivia. One of us developed a custom <a href="https://github.com/krawthekrow/pi-connect">site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/krawthekrow/pi-connect-maker">tool</a> to host these games. It took me a while to warm up to Jonathan Coulton’s latest album, but since it happened, I cannot get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXuxwWm4huM">Ordinary Man</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vig5byZx2Ew">Sunshine</a> out of my head; I’m still listening to JoCo as I finish typing up this post. Although I never got back to the peak of my crossword frenzy, I still study crosswordese from time to time and compose crosswords for some special occasions, like <a href="/misc/christmas-somewhere.puz">this one (.puz file)</a>.</p>
<p>The academics and technical aspects of this year have all blurred together, but I think my interests are finally crystallizing:</p>

	<p>A more accurate but less informative title for this post would be “How I wish React and Redux were explained to me”. Note that this does <em>not</em> imply that this method of explanation is suitable for anybody else. I suspect it won’t be for most people.</p>
<p>I had to learn React and Redux the past summer for my internship at MemSQL, and there were hundreds of articles that explain React and Redux in addition to the (fine) built-in documentation, but none of them scratched the itch; I wanted to know what was going on completely, including some of the technical details and the philosophy I ought to be following, as well as efficiently. I did not need another explanation about how to think functionally, in JavaScript types or with immutable data. React’s chapter on <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html">Conditional Rendering</a>, for example, felt so inefficient — I know what <code>if</code> statements and conditional expressions are, and I know how to refactor complicated subexpressions into variables…</p>
<p>So here’s the guide I wish I had. I think. It’s been months since I started it (as usual, for posts on this blog) and it is probably incomplete. However, I haven’t written React/Redux deeply in a while, so I didn’t have much motivation to continue to investigate the incomplete bits; and the perfect is the enemy of the good, so here it is.</p>

<p>A much belated post. This is a pwn challenge on a custom online wargaming platform. We are provided with the assembly of what’s ostensibly a programmable logic controller (PLC) for a centrifuge in a nuclear reactor. The challenge looks like it’s still up, so you can take a look and follow along.</p>
<p>This was the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">ROP</a> (okay, spoiler, it’s a ROP) I ever pulled off live during an actual CTF, which I was pretty excited about. The web platform meant I had to worry less about setup, and even though some of the tools it provided were a little lacking (no gdb shortcuts like <code>until</code>, no pwntools utilities for packing/unpacking numbers, … no <code>one_gadget</code>), I think they ultimately made the whole thing a lot more educational for me, so kudos to the folks behind it. I’ve included a brief description of all the exploit techniques that lead up to ROP when we get to that, so hopefully this post will be useful even if you don’t know much about pwning binaries. The prerequisites would be some knowledge with x86 assembly, how executables are loaded into memory, and how to use <code>gdb</code> (or fictionalized web knockoffs thereof).</p>

<p>We get a server that will talk to us on a port and a <code>flag.ctf</code> file that’s definitely not a binary.

I was @-mentioned as the person who might want to due to solving bananaScript (CSAW CTF Quals 2017) as a black box, although that gave a binary that it was possible in theory to reverse. Here black-box reversing is the only option.</p>
<p>For the first few lines of input that the server wants, it responds with quite helpful error messages to help you appease it. If the first line you give it is not <code>P6</code>, it complains:</p>

<p>This challenge is a simple chat app written in NodeJS. The home page redirects you to a chat room labeled with a random UUID. Anybody can join the same chat room with the URL.</p>
<p><img src="/img/cat-chat-0.png" alt="Fresh Cat Chat room" /></p>
<p>In a chat room, you can chat and issue two commands, <code>/name</code> to set your name and <code>/report</code> to report that somebody is talking about dogs. After anybody in the chat room issues <code>/report</code>, the admin shows up, listens for a while, and bans anybody who mentions the word “dog”.</p>
<p>There are two more commands, <code>/secret</code> and <code>/ban</code>, which are in the server source code and also described in comments in the HTML source if you didn’t notice:</p>

	<p>The hardest challenge of not very many I solved in this CTF. What a struggle! I have a long way to improve. It was pretty fun though. (I solved “You Already Know”, and got the essence of “ghettohackers: Throwback”, but didn’t guess the right flag format and believe I was asleep when they released the hint about it.)</p>
<p>The challenge consists of a simple PHP script that opens a MySQL connection and then feeds our input into a custom PHP extension <code>shellme.so</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode php"><code class="sourceCode php"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="kw">$link</span> = <span class="fu">mysqli_connect</span><span class="ot">(</span><span class="st">&#39;localhost&#39;</span><span class="ot">,</span> <span class="st">&#39;shellql&#39;</span><span class="ot">,</span> <span class="st">&#39;shellql&#39;</span><span class="ot">,</span> <span class="st">&#39;shellql&#39;</span><span class="ot">);</span></a>

<p>The extension basically just executes <code>$_POST['shell']</code> as shellcode after a strict SECCOMP call, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</a>(<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.16.8/source/include/uapi/linux/prctl.h#L68">22</a>, <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.1/source/include/uapi/linux/seccomp.h#L10">1</a>). This means that we can only use the four syscalls <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and <code>exit</code>, and <code>sigreturn</code>, where the latter two aren’t particularly useful.</p>

	<p>We are presented with a big zip file of SML code, which implements an interpreter for a small ML-like language with a form of taint analysis in its type checker, called <em>Wolf</em>. Concretely, every type in Wolf’s type system has an associated <em>secrecy</em>: it is either “private” or “public”, and in theory, the type system makes it impossible to do any computation on private data to get a public result.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a CTF, so the challenge is all about breaking the theoretical guarantees of the type system. When we submit code, it’s evaluated in a context with a private integer variable <code>flag</code>; our code is typechecked, executed, and printed, but only if its type is public. The goal is to break the type system and write code that produces a public value that depends on <code>flag</code>, so that we can exfiltrate <code>flag</code> itself.</p>
<p>In all, there are three progressively harder Wolf problems, named Pupper, Doggo, and Woofer. Doggo and Woofer are each encrypted with the flag of the challenge before it, so that you need to solve them in order (unless you can somehow blindly exploit servers running SML programs).</p>
<h3 id="wolf-overview">Wolf Overview</h3>
<p>Let’s first go over the Wolf syntax and semantics. (There are small differences between the three problems, but they’re syntactically identical and only semantically differ in cases that we’ll naturally get to.) The <code>examples</code> folder has some examples of valid code:</p>

	<p>It feels a little surreal watching #DeleteFacebook.</p>
<p>On one hand, despite how hard it is to keep an issue trending in today’s fast news cycle, this issue has managed to continue burning for a while. Somewhat recently (March 21), we got two high-profile Facebook account deletions from <a href="https://twitter.com/brianacton/status/976231995846963201">Brian Acton (WhatsApp cofounder)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/23/elon-musk-deletes-own-spacex-and-tesla-facebook-pages-after-deletefacebook/">Elon Musk</a>. Other apparent examples include <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/03/28/playboy-dumps-facebook-amid-public-furor-over-users-data-leaks/465156002/">Playboy and Cher</a>, or see <a href="http://time.com/money/5220854/delete-facebook-celebrities-companies-cutting-ties-privacy/">Time</a> or <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/several-companies-and-people-are-pulling-back-from-facebook/">CNET</a> for a few more. Facebook’s U.S. and Canada user base <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/1/31/16957122/facebook-daily-active-user-decline-us-canda-q4-earnings-2018">declined for the first time last quarter</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for me and for a lot of people, the scandal just doesn’t seem that qualitatively different from things we’ve known about Facebook for a long time — its stance on privacy, its psychological effects, its willingness to manipulate the user experience. Why is this time different? (Here’s the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/87u9ro/why_is_everyone_all_of_a_sudden_mad_at_facebook/">/r/NoStupidQuestions thread.</a> I don’t actually know which answer I believe the most.)</p>
<p>Is this time really different? I’m not optimistic. The decline could simply be Facebook running out of potential users to add and space to grow. According to a recent Raymond James survey, about half of surveyed users did not plan to change how much they used Facebook, while only 8% would stop using it, and this may still be an overestimate of people who will actually leave or delete their accounts.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Mark Zuckerberg himself <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/mark-zuckerberg-q-and-a.html">told the New York Times</a>, “I don’t think we’ve seen a meaningful number of people act on [the #DeleteFacebook campaign]”.</p>
<p>I myself have to admit upfront that, even though I <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/me-and-facebook">barely use Facebook any more</a> and have carefully contemplated deleting my Facebook account for a long time, I still haven’t pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>Why? What will it take to change this?</p>
