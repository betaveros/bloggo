      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wait, are you serious? Under two weeks left, is that what it’s come to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened to my majestic plans to go over every functional equation I failed on, ever? Or to go through a super-intense geometry-immersion period and actually try to develop some of that crazy “intuition” thing? And I have &lt;em&gt;finals&lt;/em&gt; coming up too! I just finished a ludicrous deadline-extended geography project that I am absolutely confident is the crappiest paper of my entire school career so far! And despite a semester of (slacking) classes, my Spanish is still only barely at a usable level! Exclamation marks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t panic… let’s focus on the positive. I am absolutely prepared with my stationery. I bought three spanking new 0.4mm pens that say “Can write for 1000 meters!” because all of my current ones are annoyingly thick and constantly having almost-but-not-quite run out, plus three new mechanical pencils and enough matching 2B lead to last me through college. All the pencils and lead are Pentel. I haven’t done any research, so if something terrible happens in Argentina I know what company to blame, and I am writing it here so I won’t confuse the brands. Also, in view of what happened to SCH’s carry-on baggage last year (luckily there was no geo on Day 1), I got an extra compass I hope won’t be needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’re listing all the &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; I have gotten ready:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
