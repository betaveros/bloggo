      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Faux-philosophical blog content, posted as part of a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak I have openly committed to&lt;/a&gt;; standard disclaimers apply)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hard essay to write because (1) it’s very irrational and I should (and I do) know better — death by car accident is much more likely than death by an airplane crash, but the latter is scarier because it’s more vivid and we have less control over it, and (2) people don’t like talking about it. When I tried writing it, though, I realized I already burned through most of the down-to-earth worries in the posts I made between April and August of 2010. They still coherently and accurately sum up my current thoughts surprisingly well. And most of the irrational, overly philosophical fears appeared in &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/midnight&#34;&gt;Thoughts at Midnight&lt;/a&gt;. So there used to be a lot of fluff here like this, which was inducing procrastination because I don’t know what to include and what to cut, but now that I have a daily deadline, I cut most of it. Here’s what’s left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One, xkcd:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two, bonus quote: As really-long-term readers know, I have had a reason to think that I might actually die in the past few years, a real reason that has stayed with me and gotten me thinking now and then about what &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; meaning of life is, instead of a short-lived fuzzy philosophical feeling obtained from reading &lt;cite&gt;Tuesdays with Morrie&lt;/cite&gt; (which is not to say that &lt;cite&gt;Tuesdays with Morrie&lt;/cite&gt; isn’t a good book; I just suspect no book can convey everything a personal experience can.) Anyway, it’s over in all likelihood, but the point is that in the middle, I wrote an essay for class in ninth grade, which I find equally coherent and equally representative of my views. The conclusion runs thus:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
