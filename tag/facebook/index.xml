      <title>Me and Facebook</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr: I don’t use Facebook much. If you want to contact me, I would prefer nearly any other mode of communication. I am also going to stop autosharing posts from this blog onto Facebook. RSS readers are great; get yours today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I checked Facebook and it said something like “You’ve added N friends this past T units of time! Thanks for making the world more connected!” and I just couldn’t any more. Facebook friends are not friends. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar&#39;s_number&#34;&gt;Dunbar’s number&lt;/a&gt; is around 150, maybe double that if you want to stretch it; humans cannot handle that many human relationships. Facebook’s siloed ecosystem is the opposite of connected with the rest of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is one of many reasons I pretty much don’t use Facebook any more. This is not new, but I’ve never formalized it. Also, I figure others might assume otherwise since I still do have an account and still accept friend requests and post sometimes. Thus, I’m writing this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are all of the reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>College Questions (unprotected ver.)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post, or most of it, was published password-protected once because… well, I explain that below. (To the one person who actually bothered asking me for the password, just so you know, I did add and rewrite parts. More than a few.) I forgot how distinctly powerful a disincentive a large 2300-word block of text is to the average person, especially when the subject of half of those 2300 words is teenage angst (I’ve already linked to &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/1370/&#34;&gt;xkcd 1370&lt;/a&gt; in enough places so I’m not even going to embed it here) interweaved with an insufferable amount of rationalist jargon. This will probably filter my readership more than sufficiently already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have still decided to protect one detail of the thought process, though. But even after that, I guess I do care more about how many people read this than I do for most of my other posts, so here’s a primitive attempt to gauge interest; if you choose anything beyond the first choice, I would also appreciate if you leave a comment, even if you don’t think you have anything to add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ins datetime=&#34;2017-11-24T18:33:34-0500&#34;&gt;
edit: This poll has been removed, it wasn’t very interesting anyway.
&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t posted for a long period again, but I don’t feel too bad about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, until I look carefully at my blog draft folder and remember that I have 90%-finished drafts about the two debate competitions I went to (November 2013 and March 2014), and winning the previous Mystery Hunt (January 2014), and my summer trip to Penghu (July 2013). Which will probably never get posted out of awkwardness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’ve been busy, completely righteously busy, with college apps to write and algorithm classes to teach and speeches to write and a math club to sort-of lead and all the typical homework besides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then (for those of you who don’t have me as a friend on Facebook) I got accepted to MIT and Caltech early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for a few days after that, I checked Facebook about sixteen times a day for the Class of 2019 group discussion, except for one day when I really needed not to, thanks to the power of committing to my HabitRPG party to do something. I am increasingly learning that procrastination is something that has to be actively and strategically fought. But that’s not what this post is about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
