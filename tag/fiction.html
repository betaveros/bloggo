	<p>It’s another weekend, isn’t it.</p>
<p>I’m out of deep things to say. I don’t usually have deep things to say. Sorry to anybody who subscribed hoping for more things like the last post. This is basically going to be a personal stream of consciousness post. But it’s a stream with a long ancestry, since I apparently wrote 400 words about it in a WordPress draft four years ago. This was way back before I even started writing post drafts in Markdown on my computer instead of directly in WordPress, so I guess it must be an interesting topic.</p>
<p>Four years ago, Brian<sub>2012</sub> was suddenly struck by how many of the people he knew were such serious gamers. But let’s go back even earlier, shall we?</p>
<hr />
<p>A long long time ago, when I was in elementary school or so, my parents had some sort of reward system where I had to do productive things, like study or do chores or write diary entries or practice the piano or something, to earn time on the computer for games. “Gaming time” was a currency. I enjoyed saving up lots of thirty-minute increments and knowing I had the freedom to using them slowly.</p>
<p>That much I remember; the details of how it worked are very fuzzy and I’m not sure what I played in those thirty-minute increments either. I think there was Neopets and Runescape and Club Penguin. (My Neopets account still sees sporadic activity, because I get really really bored sometimes…)</p>

	<p>(So. It’s spring break. Two-week-late post, and somehow by the end it’s all aboard the angst train again?)</p>
<p>Two Sundays ago, I mobbed with a small group of MIT furries to watch <cite>Zootopia</cite>, the recent highly-reputed Disney movie.</p>
<p>(Before anything else, first there were the previews. I was impressed that every single one of them — there were six or so — was about an upcoming movie featuring anthropomorphic animals front and center. Let me see if I can remember all of them… in no particular order, <cite>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</cite>, <cite>The Secret Life of Pets</cite>, <cite>The Jungle Book</cite>, <cite>Storks</cite>, <cite>Finding Dory</cite>, and <cite>Ice Age: Collision Course</cite>. <ins datetime="2016-04-09T05:10:42+00:00">edit: Oh, also <cite>Angry Birds</cite>.</ins> Wow, I said, they know their audience.)</p>
<p>I went into the movie with a vague impression that <cite>Zootopia</cite> was more adult-oriented than most Disney films — not in the naughty way, but in general making a lot of jokes and invoking a lot of parallels that I think only adults might have the experience to get. My suspicions were confirmed a few lines into the movie, where there was a joke about taxes I cracked up at but can’t imagine that children a few years younger would have found funny. If you the reader haven’t watched it, I hope that was vague enough not to ruin the start for you.</p>
<p>(To be fair — and, uh, some parts of the internet are kind of big on this fact — the film also at one point enters a nudist colony. Fortunately (?), <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsLackAttributes">Animals Lack Attributes</a>.)</p>

	<p>This is not Part 3. It’s just two things I thought of tacking on to <a href="https://betaveros.wordpress.com/2015/07/04/more-fiction-2/">part 2</a>.</p>
<p>What can I say? Part 2s are easy blog post fodder; Part 2 appendixes are even easier.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One, there’s one other wall I run into often during those rare attempts when I get motivated enough to try to write a story: naming characters is hard. At least, it provides an excellent motivational roadblock whenever I even consider committing a story to paper, a point before I’ve actually written anything at which I think “maybe I should give up and go on Facebook instead” and proceed to do so. Aggh. And I think there’s more than one reason for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
I have trouble coming up with names to some degree. Sure, it’s easy to browse BabyNames.com and look for choices, but a lot of the names there are really weird and contemplating them for every unimportant character kind of rips me out of the immersed mindset.
</li>
<li>
Reading great stories in English class and elsewhere may have gotten me feeling like every name ought to be a deep meaningful allusion, or at least pun fodder. I feel like I will regret it if I write a story and, a few months and/or chapters down the road, realize I missed a better name or the name I chose has some undesirable connotations in context or provides an atmosphere-ruining coincidence.
</li>
<li>
<p>But I think the real kicker is simply that some part of me is terrified of the awkwardness of giving a character the same name as anybody I know, because then they might read the story and wonder if the character is somehow based on them. And too many of the names that I consider common enough to not lure readers off into looking for hidden meanings are used up that way. This is obviously worst if the character is an antagonist. But it seems just as awkward if the character is a protagonist in accord with everything I’ve written, i.e. a paper-thin character blatantly created for escapist purposes. I am already kind of terrified I might ever meet anybody with the same name as one of my mentally established characters even though I haven’t actually written anything about him. And there’s a well-established convention of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">not reusing a first name in a work</a>, so this gets even harder with every work; I’m just as worried, what if somebody thinks this character is related to the other character in that story I wrote in second grade? Oh no!!</p>
<p>It’s like not reusing variable names in a programming language where everything is in the same scope. Positively nightmarish.</p>
And I actually discovered some evidence this is a thing in my past: I found some stories I wrote in 2004. They are possibly the most extreme exemplification of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhatYouKnow">Write What You Know</a> imaginable: the main character, Michael, goes to school and makes friends. That’s all.

<p>I kind of want to share these stories, but fast-forward a few years and you’ll see that a classmate named Michael entered my grade and we stayed in the same grade until we graduated.</p>

<p>This is not any better than the <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/nuclear">first installment</a>, but I need to post. And then, you know, do homework and presentations and stuff.</p>
<hr />
<p>Dr. Carver had just managed to drill past Dr. Perkins’s cranium when she heard the door behind her creak open.</p>
<p>“Ha! You walked right into my trap!”</p>
<p>She turned around. Dr. Perkins was standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>She looked down. Yes, they were both Dr. Perkins, she’d know that pair of glasses and spiky hair anywhere.</p>
<p>She looked up. Well, the guy in the doorway was wearing a set of black robes outside his white lab coat, but other than that, they really looked completely identical.</p>

	<p><a href="//blog.vero.site/post/more-fiction-1">Part 1 was here</a>. This is still part of the <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">daily posting streak I have openly committed to</a> and standard disclaimers still apply. Just as in <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/fiction">my original post</a>, back to the flip side — let’s see what I have to do to <em>write</em> fiction to my own satisfaction. And this time I have a guide: the list I made in the first part of this post. Could I create fiction I would enjoy reading?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1: I enjoy calling things before they happen…</p>
2: …I also enjoy the Reveal for questions when the author has done something clever I didn’t catch…

	<p>I’m going to do it again! I’m going to break a post into parts to milk it for the <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">daily posting streak</a>. Desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>
<p>This is mostly a self-analysis post though.</p>
<p>WARNING: <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TVTropesWillRuinYourVocabulary">This post contains many, many TVTropes links.</a> If you are like me and need to be productive but are <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife">liable to being sucked into TVTropes</a>, maybe you should find a way to commit to not clicking on any of these links, or just stop reading. The <a href="https://xkcd.com/609/">obligatory xkcd</a> is kind of long and also featured on one of the TVTropes links I’ve already made, so I’m not going to embed it.</p>
<p>I <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/fiction">blogged about this before in 2013</a> — how I felt that the analysis trained into me by English class was dulling my ability to appreciate and write the types of fiction I really enjoyed. After thinking about it I realized the mismatch goes deeper than that. Because the things I seek the most in fiction are escapism and entertainment. I like simple fiction with obvious (though maybe not <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">that obvious</a>) <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Aesops</a> and extreme economy of characters via making all the reveals being of the form “X and Y are the same person” (which does not quite seem to be a trope but may be an occurrence of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConnectedAllAlong">Connected All Along</a>, with the most famous subtrope being <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">Luke, I Am Your Father</a> (which is <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">a misquote</a>!), and is also one common <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockEpilepticTrees">Stock Epileptic Tree</a>, so maybe this isn’t the best example), because not only are such reveals fun, they make the plot simpler. What can I say, it works.</p>
<p>The qualities of being thought-provoking or heartwarming are only bonuses for me; needless <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JigsawPuzzlePlot">complexity in the number of characters or plots</a> is a strict negative. Sorry, I don’t want to spend effort trying to remember which person is which and how a hundred different storylines relate to each other if they don’t build to a convincing, cohesive, and <em>awesome</em> <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">Reveal</a>, and often not even then. And I like closure, so I feel pretty miserable when writers <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">resolve a long-awaited plot point just to add a bunch more</a>. Because of this I am ambivalent about long book series; most of my favorite works of fiction have come in long series but starting a new one always gives me <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommitmentAnxiety">Commitment Anxiety</a>. Even when there’s closure, when I finish an immersive movie or book I’m always left kind of disoriented, like I’ve just been lifted out of a deep pool and have to readjust to breathing and seeing the world from the perspective of a normal person on land. I like when I’m reading good fiction, but I don’t like going through withdrawal symptoms. If I want to read complicated open-ended events, I’ll go read a history textbook, because at least the trivia might come up useful some day; if I want tough problems I’ll just look at real life and think about the possibility of college debt and having to find a job and everything. (If it wasn’t obvious yet, this is why I hyperbolically hate on <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> often.) Even worse than all of this is multiple paragraphs full of scenery and nothing else, unless of course parts or maybe all of the scenery are <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov’s Guns</a>.</p>
<p>Some part of me is embarrassed to admit this because I’ve been educated for so long about deep literature that makes social commentary or reveals an inner evil of humanity or whatever. But then again, I don’t really need an education to appreciate the simple, fun fiction I apparently do.</p>
<p>So: there are a lot of famous classics or mainstream works I can’t really enjoy too much, or in some cases, at all. And yet, sometimes a random story or webcomic will appear and I just won’t be able to stop reading. Why? I decided to try making a list of things I like in fiction: </p>

	<p>(Something something something <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">daily posting streak</a> something something standard disclaimers. My schedule is tighter than usual because IPSC is tonight and runs right up until midnight. Anyway, here’s my logic with posting this: given how long I’ve committed to posting, I’m probably going to have to dig deeply enough into my reserves to include it, and to be authentic I can’t edit the story more anyway, so I might as well do it now. (Also maybe this will pressure me into finishing and posting one of the real short stories in my blog draft folder, the same way I feel pressured to make a good puzzle after posting a bad one.) I’m not even going to reread my story because I don’t like cringing at my own writing without being able to edit it, but hopefully that makes it bad enough to be entertaining. If you didn’t know, this was for an MIT preorientation program application. Tell me if it’s bad to repost application stuff. I hope not.)</p>

	<p>“I like fantasy books! I used to read a lot of Eoin Colfer.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean, <em>used to</em>? You don’t read anymore? That’s so <em>sa-a-a-ad</em>…”</p>
<p>Our teacher and I had this conversation during our first English class, and I realized I agreed with her. Well, no, of course I still read: news articles, r/AskReddit threads, and the books we get assigned in class. But not fiction, almost. As I later mentioned to my teacher, I followed Sam Hughes’ <a href="http://qntm.org/ra">Ra</a> avidly (something I highly recommend). That was it.</p>
<p>What does my present self still think of Eoin Colfer? Although I adored the <i>Artemis Fowl</i> books when I was younger, my interest faded, but not before I had recommended it to my sister. The conversation spurred me to get out the seventh <i>Artemis Fowl</i> book, which I had stopped reading halfway through a year ago, and finish it. It was still true that I didn’t like it as much, because I couldn’t feel the high stakes strongly in the book and I found that the joking asides compounded the problem. But a few days later, when we took a trip to the Taipei library, I found the eighth book and borrowed it, plowing through nine-tenths of the book before we left. The ending seemed to be happy but still felt counterintuitively poignant for me. In any case, I had closure.</p>
<p>So what’s the lesson? Authors vary in output too. I was naïve to suppose that because I found this book boring, I had outgrown all books that were even vaguely similar. In the same trip, I also borrowed a bunch of other random fantasy books, plus a realistic fiction book about a teenage pregnancy, just for kicks. It turned out to be surprisingly good. In a week, I read four books, cover to cover, despite a typical load of homework and chemo.</p>
Any excuses I made before about not having enough time simply don’t hold water. Still, I have yet to figure out if this sort of reading is sustainable, because not every book is so engrossing. Far from it… 
<hr />
<p>There’s a flip side, of course — writing.</p>
