      <description>&lt;p&gt;CLICKBAIT PERSONALITY TEST THAT YOU CAN DO WITHOUT SOLVING THE PUZZLE: What do you see in the puzzle image below? I have my own thoughts but I won’t bias you by posting them yet. Sound out your thoughts in the comments below! (I don’t expect this to work but I’d love to be proven wrong)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so apparently how puzzles work is I go nearly a year without posting one and then when I post a terrible one, I feel guilty and obligated to post a legitimate one soon after. Testsolved by chaotic_iak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a Fillomino (write a number in every empty cell so that every group of cells with the same number that is connected through its edges has that number of cells) where each tetromino has had their 4s replaced by one of L, I, T, or S describing their shape, and they obey the rules of LITS — they can touch if they are not congruent, they must all be connected, and their squares cannot form a 2×2 block. In addition, cells separated by a thick border may not contain the same number or letter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nice and tricky. (I think.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact I tried to be too tricky and spent a very long time fixing an ambiguity. It was worth it though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/lits.html&#34;&gt;LITS - Nikoli.&lt;/a&gt; Exactly one tetromino per region, no 2x2s, they’re connected, adjacent tetrominoes are noncongruent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made this a long time ago but put it off until I had programmed enough to digitize it without my fingers leaving the home row. I think the finish is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
