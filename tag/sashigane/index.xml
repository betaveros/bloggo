      <description>This is a Fillomino puzzle where every polyomino is required to be an L-shape, as in Sashigane. Write a number in every empty cell so that every group of cells with the same number that is connected through its edges is an L-shape (with arms of positive length and 1-cell thickness) with that number of cells.
My second, and now symmetric, attempt at this crazy self-invented mutant; puzzle 22 was the first.</description>

May be slightly reminiscent of no-rectangle Fillominoes. Slightly… (Has anybody done this before? It seems so interesting that I feel like I couldn’t be first.</description>
