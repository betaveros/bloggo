	<p>And it’s not even January any more.</p>
<p>(Thing negative two: Thing zero, which is at the bottom of this post, contains two puzzles by me. Skip there if that sounds interesting and text walls don’t.)</p>
<p>Thing negative one: I abandoned this blog (again). The last month has been a mess and much of it is political stuff of the sort that I’m the worst/slowest at writing about.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thing one: I was on-site for a second MIT Mystery Hunt.</p>

	<p>I finally did it.</p>
<p>I was on-site for the 2016 MIT Mystery Hunt. I even <em>solved a metapuzzle</em>. This year I hunted with ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈, the team primarily but not overwhelmingly formed from floorpi, my dorm floor. (Perhaps somewhat regrettably, I didn’t contribute to any events or runarounds or things given to HQ, unless you count attending a “recitation” for Student Simulator (round King Arthur, second from left).)</p>
<p>(Also, I made this post. Has it been two weeks already? Okay, that’s not an unusual timeframe.)</p>
<p>But wow, I got to touch so many puzzles.</p>
<p>Non-spoilery comments on particularly memorable puzzles I did, which are disproportionately programming-related, if anybody wants to look at them (I am describing how to get to the puzzle from the round instead of linking because I’m lazy and links might rot but the instructions will hopefully survive archival (although turns out there’s actually a <a href="http://huntception.com/toc.html">table of contents</a> so I don’t know what I’m doing)):</p>

	As usual, there had to be something here. In fact, this year, there are several somethings. Hype!
This is based on an idea by chaotic_iak. You can check your answers here. Text above this horizontal rule is not part of the puzzle.
ETA 11/17 16:15 UTC−5: Adjusted spacing between the bottom numbers after feedback. The puzzle is otherwise the same, and solving should not be significantly impacted.  Solvers (in my local UTC−5 because I’m lazy):

	<p>Well, it’s been over a week, which is a long time for blog posts to be delayed after the event they’re documenting in probably all of the world except my blog. So.</p>
<p>I guess this post should start with a bit of background. I’ve been puzzlehunting for… wow, three and a half years now. I was introduced to puzzlehunts from AoPS, when some fellow members got together a team for <a href="http://puzzle.cisra.com.au/2011/teamstats_AoPS.html">CiSRA 2011</a>, and I think I’ve participated to some degree in every known internet Australian puzzlehunt since.</p>

<p>So, I somehow managed to <a href="http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~mums/puzzlehunt/teamstats.html?team=not+AoPS">get 25 points all by myself</a> in <a href="http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~mums/puzzlehunt/">MUMS Puzzle Hunt 2013</a>. Well, I pestered chaotic_iak a little with <a href="http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~mums/puzzlehunt/2013/puzzles/3.3_Diagnosus_ghQ3AcbJ.html">3.3 Diagnosus (.html with animated .gif)</a> but we still didn’t recognize all the Pokémon until hint 3, at which point Google sufficed for me.</p>
<p>This is nowhere near the top, but compared to the usual results of whatever AoPS team I form, it’s amazing. By far the best result of AoPS was on CiSRA in 2010 (46th with 58 points), before I discovered puzzle hunts in AoPS; unfortunately due to people getting older and the influx of younger and younger people to the fora, there are less possible teammates each year and they have less time, so here I am by myself. (Also I could have accepted an invitation from a guy in the some-form-of-Elephant team, but I figure if you can win two MUMS hunts in a row you don’t need any more people.)</p>
<p>All in all: Yay!</p>

<p>So winter vacation started and parents had planned a trip to southern Taiwan, to get closer to nature and walk around and stuff.</p>
<p>Also, the MIT Mystery Hunt, the absolute granddaddy of all the other puzzlehunts in terms of age, structure, and size, happened this weekend. Originally, I didn’t have a team and just planned to look at the puzzles after they got archived and <s>try solving some puzzles</s> read the solutions while constantly thinking, “How could anybody ever solve that?” Because of that, I wasn’t planning to even bring my laptop at first; then I could force myself to study some long-overdue ring theory during the nights. I was taken aback by a private message on Saturday morning from somebody with many different names inviting me to remote-solve for Random Thymes.</p>
