	<p>My third MIT Mystery Hunt with ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈ (also see: <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/january">2017</a> and <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/whoosh">2016</a>, writing with Random in <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/hunt">2015</a>). It was a good hunt with a fun theme, solid puzzles, and extraordinary production quality, marred only by a fickle unlock structure and a handful of unnecessarily involved extractions.</p>
<p>Since we had been told the hunt would be smaller than past years’ (now a controversial statement since the coin was <em>not</em> found particularly early) and we didn’t particularly want to win (yet), part of our team temporarily split off this year to hunt as Teammate. Based on our Discord channel, ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈ had 75 people this year, including remote solvers and people who dropped in and out.</p>
<p>A short description of the hunt structure: This year’s hunt theme was <em>Inside Out</em>, the Disney movie about anthropomorphized emotions. This was revealed through a kickoff that demonstrated the hunt’s extraordinary production quality, in which we watched the unveiling of the Health &amp; Safety hunt, first directly, then in the Control Room with the emotions of a distraught hunter (Miss Terry Hunter) and a lot of beautiful memory orbs and scenery. After Terry’s emotions became overwhelmed in response to the theme, we had to help her emotions to allow her to complete the Health &amp; Safety hunt. The intro round took place in the Control Room; we had to solve 34 regular puzzles and five metapuzzles (somewhat overlapping, with some regular puzzles belonging to more than one metapuzzle) to help each of the five emotions get back to the Control Room. The rest of the hunt consisted of recovering memory orbs from each of four Islands of Personality, each of which had its own theme and meta structure, and which we could choose the unlock order of.</p>

	<p>And it’s not even January any more.</p>
<p>(Thing negative two: Thing zero, which is at the bottom of this post, contains two puzzles by me. Skip there if that sounds interesting and text walls don’t.)</p>
<p>Thing negative one: I abandoned this blog (again). The last month has been a mess and much of it is political stuff of the sort that I’m the worst/slowest at writing about.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thing one: I was on-site for a second MIT Mystery Hunt.</p>

	<p>I finally did it.</p>
<p>I was on-site for the 2016 MIT Mystery Hunt. I even <em>solved a metapuzzle</em>. This year I hunted with ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈, the team primarily but not overwhelmingly formed from floorpi, my dorm floor. (Perhaps somewhat regrettably, I didn’t contribute to any events or runarounds or things given to HQ, unless you count attending a “recitation” for Student Simulator (round King Arthur, second from left).)</p>
<p>(Also, I made this post. Has it been two weeks already? Okay, that’s not an unusual timeframe.)</p>
<p>But wow, I got to touch so many puzzles.</p>
<p>Non-spoilery comments on particularly memorable puzzles I did, which are disproportionately programming-related, if anybody wants to look at them (I am describing how to get to the puzzle from the round instead of linking because I’m lazy and links might rot but the instructions will hopefully survive archival (although turns out there’s actually a <a href="http://huntception.com/toc.html">table of contents</a> so I don’t know what I’m doing)):</p>

	<p>Well, it’s been over a week, which is a long time for blog posts to be delayed after the event they’re documenting in probably all of the world except my blog. So.</p>
<p>I guess this post should start with a bit of background. I’ve been puzzlehunting for… wow, three and a half years now. I was introduced to puzzlehunts from AoPS, when some fellow members got together a team for <a href="http://puzzle.cisra.com.au/2011/teamstats_AoPS.html">CiSRA 2011</a>, and I think I’ve participated to some degree in every known internet Australian puzzlehunt since.</p>

	<p>Well, there had to be something here.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don’t have time for anything more complex, so here’s a low-effort illogical puzzle for the occasion. (It <em>has</em> been testsolved, at least. Thanks, Yoshiap.) It also features a brand new category, so as not to distract the people on LMI.</p>
<p>If you don’t already know what occasion it is, it’s easy to find out by looking through my archives or possibly anywhere else I’ve left a trail online. Or you could solve the puzzle! (Or you could <ins datetime="2014-11-20T12:29:52+00:00">scroll down to read the solution!</ins>) If this puzzle had an answer, it would be a nine-letter word, although like most of mathematics, it’s less about the answer than about the path you take to get there…</p>
<ins datetime="2017-11-24T18:36:41-0500">
2017 edit: A warning that this has somewhat linkrotted and is harder to solve, but theoretically still possible.

Edit 11/19 7:23 AM UTC+8: Fixed some transcription errors on right: <strong>R4C17 is D instead of N, and R15C17 is G instead of E.</strong> Neither change should greatly impact solvability. Thanks to ksun for pointing out an error.
</ins>
<p>Logic puzzles are easy to construct if one doesn’t have some specific pattern or theme in mind. It’s just that, given the increasing number of constructors and puzzles with amazing themes, I don’t think it’s very meaningful for me to just construct more puzzles of the same genres by putting down clues randomly. That’s why, for my seventeenth birthday, I took the puzzlehunt route and made something without instructions that is not completely solved by logical deduction. Still, I’ve provided all the information needed to do this puzzle initially, so I hope my not getting the inductive bits test-solved can be excused.</p>
