	<p>I hate doing things under time pressure, but I have to admit I do a lot more things when time pressure exists. One of the things is writing. Another is posting the things I write. They aren’t very good, but they’re better than writing that doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>(in case you forgot, I’m still posting this pretty much only because <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/no-excuses">I made myself post once every weekend</a>)</p>
<p>It’s interesting that I can impose time pressure on myself by declaring commitment devices by fiat and it works. Other people have developed other methods of doing this — I recently discovered <a href="http://www.themostdangerouswritingapp.com/">The Most Dangerous Writing App</a>, which puts time pressure on you to type every five seconds or it deletes everything you wrote. There are many other ways it’s done.</p>

	<p>“I like fantasy books! I used to read a lot of Eoin Colfer.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean, <em>used to</em>? You don’t read anymore? That’s so <em>sa-a-a-ad</em>…”</p>
<p>Our teacher and I had this conversation during our first English class, and I realized I agreed with her. Well, no, of course I still read: news articles, r/AskReddit threads, and the books we get assigned in class. But not fiction, almost. As I later mentioned to my teacher, I followed Sam Hughes’ <a href="http://qntm.org/ra">Ra</a> avidly (something I highly recommend). That was it.</p>
<p>What does my present self still think of Eoin Colfer? Although I adored the <i>Artemis Fowl</i> books when I was younger, my interest faded, but not before I had recommended it to my sister. The conversation spurred me to get out the seventh <i>Artemis Fowl</i> book, which I had stopped reading halfway through a year ago, and finish it. It was still true that I didn’t like it as much, because I couldn’t feel the high stakes strongly in the book and I found that the joking asides compounded the problem. But a few days later, when we took a trip to the Taipei library, I found the eighth book and borrowed it, plowing through nine-tenths of the book before we left. The ending seemed to be happy but still felt counterintuitively poignant for me. In any case, I had closure.</p>
<p>So what’s the lesson? Authors vary in output too. I was naïve to suppose that because I found this book boring, I had outgrown all books that were even vaguely similar. In the same trip, I also borrowed a bunch of other random fantasy books, plus a realistic fiction book about a teenage pregnancy, just for kicks. It turned out to be surprisingly good. In a week, I read four books, cover to cover, despite a typical load of homework and chemo.</p>
<p>Any excuses I made before about not having enough time simply don’t hold water. Still, I have yet to figure out if this sort of reading is sustainable, because not every book is so engrossing. Far from it…</p>
