	<p>(Frivolous blog content, posted as part of a <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">daily posting streak I have openly committed to</a>; standard disclaimers apply)</p>
<p>Out of boredom and curiosity, I <a href="https://betaveros.github.io/bars-college.html">graphed how many emails colleges sent me</a>, excluding the colleges I actually applied to. I am being extremely polite and just calling them emails. I’ve wanted to make this for a long time, but it wasn’t until I saw this <a href="https://medium.com/message/my-failed-experiment-in-time-travel-3aa2240a6bc0">post about an email experiment</a> on <a href="http://waxy.org/links/">waxy.org/links</a> that I understood which tools I could use to quantify my emails. (And then I actually made it and procrastinated posting it here for two months. If you look at my GitHub page or activity you might have seen it already, though. Oops.)</p>
<p>I don’t think the results were expected. Other than saying that, I leave the interpretation up to the reader because I’m on a tight blogging schedule. Cool? Cool.</p>

	<p>After the first stage of selection camp, I was very nervous because I was fifth place in a selection sequence that would finally result in a team of four.</p>
<p>I screwed myself over on the first mock test by committing to a bad implementation method on a problem that was hard to get points on. My method seemed simple, but the memory usage leaked out in a way that was confusing and hard to patch; unfortunately, I tried to patch it in increasingly desperate and convoluted ways rather than scrapping the method, and thus missed out on many of the points elsewhere.</p>
<p>During the second test I failed to read the last problem carefully and spent too much of my time on the second problem, once again missing out on a lot of relatively easy points. I had optimized and optimized and pushed my quadratic runtime down to linearithmic, which would allow me to get the points for the last subtask — or so I thought. But with 10 minutes left I had all but one testcase right, and after desperately rereading my code, I realized that I had a string comparison stuck in an inner loop that could make my runtime degenerate to quadratic if the input string had lots of the same digit. In order to have a solidly linearithmic algorithm, I would have to implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_array">suffix array</a>. Ten minutes? I gave up. (The problem setters told me afterwards that hashing would have worked too; I didn’t think of that at all. Oops.) I spent the 10 minutes reading the last problem and still failed to read it carefully. So that did not go very well.</p>
<p>But, as the title probably gave away, during the third and fourth mock tests everything went much better than expected. :)</p>
