	<p>Fifth year with ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈ (previously: <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/2019-hunt">2019</a>, <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/2018-hunt">2018</a>, <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/january">2017</a>, <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/whoosh">2016</a>; writing with Random in <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/hunt">2015</a>).</p>
<p>We won!</p>
<p>But apparently I’m still really busy, so I’ll probably just focus on a few highlights of things I personally experienced and get this post out the door.</p>
<p>The theme in a few sentences: As suggested by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mysteryhunt/comments/eo475t/you_are_cordially_invited/">the invitation</a> sent out to teams, there was a wedding. It turned out to actually be a real wedding between two prolific puzzle writers on Left Out, the organizing team. To the surprise of everybody who expected either one, three, or maybe five subversions of this announcement, the wedding actually succeeded (a COIN that would prevent all love in the universe was briefly reported missing, but then immediately found by the bride). Instead, we joined the newlyweds on a trip to an amusement park called Penny Park, which we learned was struggling and closing this weekend. It was up to help its regain its popularity and stay open by solving puzzles. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mysteryhunt/">Mystery Hunt subreddit</a> has lots of other cool links and discussions, including this <a href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/1267425/">animated bar chart</a>, so I won’t spend more time here.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure the best story I personally experienced was how we solved the metameta, the biggest puzzle that stood between us and winning hunt, and the moment at which we went, holy smokes we might have won Mystery Hunt! We got all the pennies required for the final metameta at Sunday 5:48:09am, and it took us until 12:47:30pm, just under <em>seven hours later</em>, to solve it…</p>

	<p>(this post is sketchily backdated from February 2020)</p>
<p>Fourth year with ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈. Past: <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/2018-hunt">2018</a>, <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/january">2017</a>, <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/whoosh">2016</a>, writing with Random in <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/hunt">2015</a>). Evidently I was unable to find the time or motivation to blog about this, and I can’t remember any particularly good stories, so let me just slip this backdated list post in the archives.</p>
<p>The theme in a few sentences: The hunt organizers declare a new Molasses Awareness Day, but because they didn’t follow the proper procedure, throwing the world of Holidays into chaos, where “chaos” means molasses. This resulted in lots of puzzle-to-meta matching, since puzzles were in Holiday towns but metas were at lampposts between two towns.</p>
<p>Highlights of puzzles I solved:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Good Walk Spoiled</strong> (Holi): Happens to be about a topic I know well and find interesting. Fun steps. Justified use of substitution ciphers; the pasting into quipqiup was worth it.</li>
<li><strong>State Machine</strong> (President’s): A one-aha! one-step puzzle. Maybe more unfortunate because apparently this was not the only puzzle to use a specific aspect of a specific source material, but I didn’t know about that other puzzle so it’s fine.</li>
<li><strong>Clued Connections</strong> (Pi): I went to sleep near the end of this puzzle, so I didn’t see it through, but Floorpi was collectively called out by it.</li>
<li><strong>I Can’t Deal with These Endless Numbers</strong> (Patriot’s): Incredible.</li>
<li><strong>Loaded</strong> (Arbor): Simple and self-contained enough.</li>
</ul>

	<p>My third MIT Mystery Hunt with ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈ (also see: <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/january">2017</a> and <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/whoosh">2016</a>, writing with Random in <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/hunt">2015</a>). It was a good hunt with a fun theme, solid puzzles, and extraordinary production quality, marred only by a fickle unlock structure and a handful of unnecessarily involved extractions.</p>
<p>Since we had been told the hunt would be smaller than past years’ (now a controversial statement since the coin was <em>not</em> found particularly early) and we didn’t particularly want to win (yet), part of our team temporarily split off this year to hunt as Teammate. Based on our Discord channel, ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈ had 75 people this year, including remote solvers and people who dropped in and out.</p>
<p>A short description of the hunt structure: This year’s hunt theme was <em>Inside Out</em>, the Disney movie about anthropomorphized emotions. This was revealed through a kickoff that demonstrated the hunt’s extraordinary production quality, in which we watched the unveiling of the Health &amp; Safety hunt, first directly, then in the Control Room with the emotions of a distraught hunter (Miss Terry Hunter) and a lot of beautiful memory orbs and scenery. After Terry’s emotions became overwhelmed in response to the theme, we had to help her emotions to allow her to complete the Health &amp; Safety hunt. The intro round took place in the Control Room; we had to solve 34 regular puzzles and five metapuzzles (somewhat overlapping, with some regular puzzles belonging to more than one metapuzzle) to help each of the five emotions get back to the Control Room. The rest of the hunt consisted of recovering memory orbs from each of four Islands of Personality, each of which had its own theme and meta structure, and which we could choose the unlock order of.</p>

	<p>And it’s not even January any more.</p>
<p>(Thing negative two: Thing zero, which is at the bottom of this post, contains two puzzles by me. Skip there if that sounds interesting and text walls don’t.)</p>
<p>Thing negative one: I abandoned this blog (again). The last month has been a mess and much of it is political stuff of the sort that I’m the worst/slowest at writing about.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thing one: I was on-site for a second MIT Mystery Hunt.</p>

	<p>When I first made myself commit to posting weekly, I was trying to make myself spend a little time every day of the week thinking and writing and whittling away at old drafts. Instead I’m here at 10:40 PM basically starting a brand-new post. Oh well.</p>
<p>I last <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/music">blogged about music in 2013</a>. I tagged two other posts with “music” since then, but neither is particularly deep: <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/8-songs">8 Songs for 18 Years</a> and <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/drop-in">Drop-In Filler</a>. Let’s continue the tradition of self-analysis part IIs from nowhere…</p>
<hr />
<p>I meditated a little bit in <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/conversations">Conversations</a> about “lacking experience or interest in a lot of the commonly discussed culture.” I think this applies to me and music as well, although not as fully. Back in Taiwan, when mentally bracing myself for coming to the U.S. for college, I sometimes worried about not knowing enough about pop music and bands and not listening enough to popular albums, and having trouble integrating into the culture for this.</p>
<p>Turns out, among the communities I wandered into and friends I made, it was a more frequent obstacle that I didn’t know enough about classical music and composers. Whoops. Some of the names rang faint bells from either music class or conversations with high school friends who did do classical music, but I could not identify or remember any styles or eras, and would remember composers only by unreliable first letters or unusual substrings of their names.</p>

	<p>I finally did it.</p>
<p>I was on-site for the 2016 MIT Mystery Hunt. I even <em>solved a metapuzzle</em>. This year I hunted with ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈, the team primarily but not overwhelmingly formed from floorpi, my dorm floor. (Perhaps somewhat regrettably, I didn’t contribute to any events or runarounds or things given to HQ, unless you count attending a “recitation” for Student Simulator (round King Arthur, second from left).)</p>
<p>(Also, I made this post. Has it been two weeks already? Okay, that’s not an unusual timeframe.)</p>
<p>But wow, I got to touch so many puzzles.</p>
<p>Non-spoilery comments on particularly memorable puzzles I did, which are disproportionately programming-related, if anybody wants to look at them (I am describing how to get to the puzzle from the round instead of linking because I’m lazy and links might rot but the instructions will hopefully survive archival (although turns out there’s actually a <a href="http://huntception.com/toc.html">table of contents</a> so I don’t know what I’m doing)):</p>

	<p>I’m not really satisfied with the execution, but eh, what the hell. My brain can only function at so much of its full capacity when it’s a few kilometers up in the sky.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://mellowmelon.wordpress.com/2009/12/20/puzzle-135/">Triple Back</a>, variant on <a href="https://mellowmelon.wordpress.com/double-back/">MellowMelon’s Double Back</a>. Briefly, draw a closed loop through all square centers visiting each bold-outlined area exactly three (= ⌊π⌋) times. Shaded cells do not influence solving, only aesthetics.</p>

	<p>There are 30 minutes until my laundry finishes.</p>
<p>It is 2:30 in the morning as I write this. Normal people are not awake at this time of day. It’s possible that normal MIT students are, though.</p>
<p>I’ve been meaning to blog for a while, but things happen and other things happen and still more things happen. From a state of total inexperience in the kitchen, I’ve already managed to single-handedly cook six six-person meals for my co-op, not to mention all the weird meals I make for myself (which is just as well, I don’t think they are of typically mentionable caliber.) I’ve already taken two exams in three of my classes and the big midterm for my fourth. Four puzzlehunts — Simmons, aquarium, Palantir, ΣUMS; five if you perhaps include Next Haunt. Six SIPB meetings. A few bottles of Soylent; I lost count and don’t want to check my room because that’ll disturb my roommate. Θ(3000) zephyrs. And after many weekends of eye-opening group practice, tonight I have to catch a flight to Rochester, NY for ACM-ICPC regionals.</p>

	<p>As readers of this blog probably know, I am not an MITAdmissions blogger. It was kind of disappointing at the moment, but now I rarely think about it except when I come up with good reasons why I shouldn&rsquo;t be an MITAdmissions blogger. One reason is that I am not very good at coming up with advice that could generalize to a wide audience, even an audience only as wide as people at or coming to the &lsquo;Tvte. <em>(There can be only one!)</em> This by itself probably wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad because there&rsquo;s plenty of generalizable advice to go around, but I also don&rsquo;t like repeating well-known stuff. Don&rsquo;t skip class, except when you really know when you&rsquo;re doing, which you probably think you do when you skip class. Get enough sleep, maintain good study habits, set aside time to keep up with old friends, back up your zarking data, alternate alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks, do not forget the factor of one-half when computing the area of a triangle. You get the picture.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s only one piece of advice I can say that I believe is generalizable to any degree, and in particular I think my past self would have appreciated and also had not heard, even in passing, from any other source: Get a Sharpie.</p>
