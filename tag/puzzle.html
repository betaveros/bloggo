<p>This post aims to be a fairly comprehensive introduction to puzzlehunts and their puzzles, a single post where I can just point people. I erred towards comprehensiveness in this post because I am not aware of any similar resources, especially for puzzlers interested in trying harder puzzlehunts who might not know any more experienced puzzlers to solve with. It’s possible to start solving some puzzles after reading much shorter guides, e.g. Puzzled Pint’s <a href="http://www.puzzledpint.com/files/3513/8254/7894/2013_10_22_Puzzling_Basics_Infographic.pdf">“Puzzling Basics” (PDF)</a>, so feel free to skip around, stop reading midway through, or bookmark this to read only after you’ve spent more time solving.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-puzzlehunt">What is a Puzzlehunt?</h3>
<p>A <strong>puzzlehunt</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is an event where people, usually in teams, solve a series of <strong>puzzles</strong>.</p>
<p>This is not a very useful definition. The more interesting question is, what is the kind of “puzzle”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> that appears in a puzzlehunt? The concept of a puzzlehunt puzzle is fuzzy and difficult to define precisely. Just about any hard rule one might try to state will be broken by some puzzle, sometimes deliberately. Still, here are some common features of puzzlehunt puzzles:</p>

	<p>My third MIT Mystery Hunt with ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈ (also see: <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/january">2017</a> and <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/whoosh">2016</a>, writing with Random in <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/hunt">2015</a>). It was a good hunt with a fun theme, solid puzzles, and extraordinary production quality, marred only by a fickle unlock structure and a handful of unnecessarily involved extractions.</p>
<p>Since we had been told the hunt would be smaller than past years’ (now a controversial statement since the coin was <em>not</em> found particularly early) and we didn’t particularly want to win (yet), part of our team temporarily split off this year to hunt as Teammate. Based on our Discord channel, ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈ had 75 people this year, including remote solvers and people who dropped in and out.</p>
<p>A short description of the hunt structure: This year’s hunt theme was <em>Inside Out</em>, the Disney movie about anthropomorphized emotions. This was revealed through a kickoff that demonstrated the hunt’s extraordinary production quality, in which we watched the unveiling of the Health &amp; Safety hunt, first directly, then in the Control Room with the emotions of a distraught hunter (Miss Terry Hunter) and a lot of beautiful memory orbs and scenery. After Terry’s emotions became overwhelmed in response to the theme, we had to help her emotions to allow her to complete the Health &amp; Safety hunt. The intro round took place in the Control Room; we had to solve 34 regular puzzles and five metapuzzles (somewhat overlapping, with some regular puzzles belonging to more than one metapuzzle) to help each of the five emotions get back to the Control Room. The rest of the hunt consisted of recovering memory orbs from each of four Islands of Personality, each of which had its own theme and meta structure, and which we could choose the unlock order of.</p>

<p>(Thing negative two: Thing zero, which is at the bottom of this post, contains two puzzles by me. Skip there if that sounds interesting and text walls don’t.)</p>
<p>Thing negative one: I abandoned this blog (again). The last month has been a mess and much of it is political stuff of the sort that I’m the worst/slowest at writing about.</p>

<p>Thing one: I was on-site for a second MIT Mystery Hunt.</p>

	<p>I finally did it.</p>
<p>I was on-site for the 2016 MIT Mystery Hunt. I even <em>solved a metapuzzle</em>. This year I hunted with ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈, the team primarily but not overwhelmingly formed from floorpi, my dorm floor. (Perhaps somewhat regrettably, I didn’t contribute to any events or runarounds or things given to HQ, unless you count attending a “recitation” for Student Simulator (round King Arthur, second from left).)</p>
<p>(Also, I made this post. Has it been two weeks already? Okay, that’s not an unusual timeframe.)</p>
<p>But wow, I got to touch so many puzzles.</p>
<p>Non-spoilery comments on particularly memorable puzzles I did, which are disproportionately programming-related, if anybody wants to look at them (I am describing how to get to the puzzle from the round instead of linking because I’m lazy and links might rot but the instructions will hopefully survive archival (although turns out there’s actually a <a href="http://huntception.com/toc.html">table of contents</a> so I don’t know what I’m doing)):</p>

	<p>Wow, there are so many cool things in my old folder. I could probably create and schedule enough filler posts to make my <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">streak</a> last through my week-long trip and back. I guess I won’t, though, because I don’t want to dilute my textwall-draft brand more than necessary and there are a few text posts that I fully intend to post before leaving. Or at least one. Although on second thought, it’s possible they might actually not be as interesting as posts like this one about the adorable me from the past. As Pablo Picasso once said, “Youth has no age.” (Yes, I totally just went on BrainyQuote and searched for “youth”. Forgive me, please.) Oh well.</p>
<p>Today’s throwback theme is old puzzles! Particularly picture ones! In reverse chronological order by last modified time, because I said so! All the image puzzles are puzzlehunty in the sense that you’re supposed to end up with a single word or short phrase as your final answer.</p>
<h3 id="p06pre2">
<code>art/hidd3n/p06pre2.png</code> (2010/10/31)
</h3>
<p><a href="/img/p06pre2.png"><img src="/img/p06pre2.png" alt="p06pre2" width="640" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3210" /></a> A straightforward one to start. I have no idea what’s with the filename, though.</p>
<h3 id="purity2logic">
<code>haxxor/purity2/logic.html</code> (2010/10/10?)
</h3>
<p>My file hierarchy is really weird. I don’t think this time stamp is when I wrote the puzzle because it was part of a silly static site setup I created (but never actually put anywhere), and I probably edited and regenerated stuff like the breadcrumbs many times, but it’ll have to do.</p>
<p>This is also funny because the title of the HTML file is “Logic Puzzles” and the description starts, “These puzzles were made when I was really bored…”, but there’s only one puzzle.</p>
<p>Well, it’s better than an under construction page, I guess.</p>
<p>I’ll quote the entirety of the old instructions as I wrote them, even though they’re really verbose, since it’s easy to scroll past them:</p>

	<p>(Faux-philosophical blog content, posted as part of a <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">daily posting streak I have openly committed to</a>; standard disclaimers apply)</p>
<p>This is a hard essay to write because (1) it’s very irrational and I should (and I do) know better — death by car accident is much more likely than death by an airplane crash, but the latter is scarier because it’s more vivid and we have less control over it, and (2) people don’t like talking about it. When I tried writing it, though, I realized I already burned through most of the down-to-earth worries in the posts I made between April and August of 2010. They still coherently and accurately sum up my current thoughts surprisingly well. And most of the irrational, overly philosophical fears appeared in <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/midnight">Thoughts at Midnight</a>. So there used to be a lot of fluff here like this, which was inducing procrastination because I don’t know what to include and what to cut, but now that I have a daily deadline, I cut most of it. Here’s what’s left.</p>
<p>One, xkcd:</p>
<p><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/leaving.png" alt="xkcd" /></p>
<p>Two, bonus quote: As really-long-term readers know, I have had a reason to think that I might actually die in the past few years, a real reason that has stayed with me and gotten me thinking now and then about what <em>my</em> meaning of life is, instead of a short-lived fuzzy philosophical feeling obtained from reading <cite>Tuesdays with Morrie</cite> (which is not to say that <cite>Tuesdays with Morrie</cite> isn’t a good book; I just suspect no book can convey everything a personal experience can.) Anyway, it’s over in all likelihood, but the point is that in the middle, I wrote an essay for class in ninth grade, which I find equally coherent and equally representative of my views. The conclusion runs thus:</p>
