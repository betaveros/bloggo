      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;warning&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: My 2012 self wrote this. It is a little dated and does not entirely capture my current beliefs and attitudes, although I have to say it’s not too far off either. As of 2018, &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/me-and-facebook&#34;&gt;Me and Facebook&lt;/a&gt; is more relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/orange-comment.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/orange-comment.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;orange-comment&#34; width=&#34;458&#34; height=&#34;85&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1383&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Here’s a guilty secret: I like getting feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not restricting myself to painstakingly thoughtful comments that attempt to &lt;em&gt;build upon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;transform&lt;/em&gt; the post to form an interesting conversation, the kind English teachers are hellbent on promoting. Sure, I get the most kicks out of those, but I’m not picky. Even single-digit pageview bars or a handful of Facebook “like”s give me buzzes of excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a guilty feeling, because I also think that that these are unimaginably cheap internet currencies and should not qualify as “meaningful” under a rational mindset. I strongly suspect visitors accidentally click on my blog and leave after five seconds without taking in anything, because I do that all the time to other people’s blogs and sites. Sometimes it is out of boredom, sometimes it is because I actually have something of higher priority to do than indiscriminate reading, sometimes it is simply because I cannot read the language. I’ve seen plenty of people like posts on Facebook based on the poster, only occasionally taking into consideration the first word of the post in question, before actually reading them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
