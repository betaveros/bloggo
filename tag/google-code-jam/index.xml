      <title>Jam-Packed Fun and Games</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did I say “fun”? That was short for function calls. Which are fun too, admittedly. Blah, I always go to such lengths to come up with snappy yet justified post titles and end up achieving neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more complimentary breakfast later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Code Jam World Finals. &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/nametag.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/nametag.jpg?w=170&#34; alt=&#34;[Google Code Jam 2015 name tag with my name and handle and country]&#34; width=&#34;170&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3374&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Let me take a moment to reflect. Seriously. I do not know how I made it this far this year. I guess I might be a top-500-ish competitive programmer globally, maybe even top-150-ish, but definitely not top-25-ish. And &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/4254486/dashboard#s=p3&#34;&gt;Log Set&lt;/a&gt;, the hard problem that got me through Round 3, doesn’t seem like it plays to my forte particularly either. It’s a bit mathy, but the math bits aren’t the hard part; I think it’s largely implementation, with one psychological hurdle where you have to realize that, because of how few distinct integers there are in S′, you can efficiently solve the subset-sum instances you need to produce the lexicographically earliest answer. I’m actually kind of impressed I got that. It seems like the sort of hurdle I usually get stuck on. How did this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe randomness. Maybe I was just particularly clear-minded during the round and wrote less buggy code than usual, because I had no expectation of making it whatsoever and so could look at the contest detachedly (until midway through the contest I accidentally noticed that my rank was under 20, and even then I tried very very hard not to think about it, and it kind of worked).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it happened, and now I’m here. Time to roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some emails much earlier in the Code Jam logistical process, Google had asked for “requests for changes and/or additions” to the software that would be installed on our competition computers, and I had sent them a long list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;br /&gt; Here are some things I’d like if they were installed, in decreasing order of priority:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The Vim plugin syntastic ( https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic )
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
a Haskell compiler (probably Haskell Platform 2014.2.0.0 https://www.haskell.org/platform/ even though it’s a year old)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
the Haskell package hdevtools ( https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hdevtools ) so that the above two may be integrated
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
(I don’t have enough Linux experience to name a specific thing to install, but command-line utilities that are the equivalent of pbcopy and pbpaste on Mac OS X, which allow me to redirect text into or out of the clipboard from the command line easily)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Of course, this is my first Code Jam and I don’t know how reasonable these requests are. Any nontrivial subset would be appreciated.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Planes</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/planes</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a backlog of at least 6,000 words and still too many events to blog about, so these posts will not reflect things currently happening to me for a long, long time, except for the little blurbs on top of posts like this one when they exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I don’t have a good title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begins with an airplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/plane.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/plane.jpg?w=660&#34; alt=&#34;[View of airplane wing and clouds from airplane]&#34; width=&#34;660&#34; height=&#34;373&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3361&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Zarquon’s sake, you’re entrusting me with &lt;em&gt;my own passport and airline tickets and luggage and all this stuff I can’t even.&lt;/em&gt; I still layover people for months on end in &lt;cite&gt;Pocket Planes&lt;/cite&gt; sometimes. &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/cars&#34;&gt;(Watch the graceful descent of this reference into personally overused snowclone territory.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: Taiwan, my home for the previous twelve years, which I am now bidding farewell to for the longest time in forever (…which is only (“only”?) five months, assuming I fly back for winter break as already planned). Destination: Seattle, for this year’s Google Code Jam World Finals, which I still don’t know how I managed to qualify for (more on that in later posts); and, before that, an accompanying interview for an internship that I scored as part of the bargain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I successfully get on the plane, sort some nice things to have on hand into my MIT tote bag (how did I &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; survive airplanes without keeping a tote bag on hand?), and put my backpack with the rest of my stuff into the overhead compartment. An old-ish guy who is probably Korean sits next to me. Plane takeoff is a bit delayed due to traffic congestion. Once during the flight, after an attendant passes out forms to everybody entering South Korea and I tell him I’m not, the guy asks me where I’m going and we have a short conversation. But for the most part, it’s typical airplane shenanigans. I listen to Avril Lavigne and Ellie Goulding, do a little homework, and eat the airplane food. Nothing remarkable happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until near the end of the flight: a guy in a suit shows up in the aisle and, looking at some sort of checklist, calls my name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
