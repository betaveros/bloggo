	<p>I think this is the right video for this year.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/lX44CAz-JhU" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
 </div>

<p>I love the music and the animation. The music video spells out the central conceit somewhat explicitly, but I think the lyrics by themselves have a hint of ambiguity — is it a harmful addiction that you just can’t escape from, or an essential part of your identity that you just can’t deny?</p>
<p>What parts of me can I just not deny, huh? Unfortunately 2017 is also the year I decide my online presence should probably be a little more professional, so you might have to read between the lines a bit. </p>

<p>It seems to me like lots of people want this year to be over. Among all the other things, 2016 is also apparently the year I totally abandon this blog and put off certain planned posts by several months.</p>
<p>I guess this is what happens when you take five technical classes at MIT. The extracurriculars aren’t helping. And the fastest and most confident writing I do is still reactive, when there’s an externally-imposed deadline or when “somebody is wrong on the internet”. This blog isn’t.</p>
<p>Oh well, time to make up for it in 2017.</p>
<p>What happened this year? I’ll start with some serious categories:</p>

	<p>I wasn’t sure what would be the right song for 2015 until I set foot on MIT. Then it was a no-brainer.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KThlYHfIVa8" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
 </div>

<p>Where do I even begin?</p>
<ul>
<li>
I thought cooking was hard. Then I ended up in the kitchen on the third floor of the west parallel of East Campus and had to produce something edible. So I figured out how to acquire chicken and put it in a pan with some onions and heat the whole thing up. It wasn’t even that bad! A few weeks later, I graduated to cooking in a rotation for six people. All this from a guy whose culinary abilities only went as far as frying eggs a few months ago. It’s incredible where life takes you sometimes.
</li>
<li>
I thought I couldn’t productively listen to lyrical music while doing homework, because I get distracted and/or bogged down by the feels. Turns out there’s a category of metal songs with great atmosphere and terrible lyrics that does the trick.
</li>
<li>
I had planned to suffer through introductory chemistry my freshman fall and introductory biology my freshman spring, and thereafter be done with required classes. Well, I took chemistry, but there was barely any suffering involved, and now biology fits nowhere on my freshman spring schedule.
</li>
<li>
<p>I had some outlandish hopes I’d walk into college and be able to become mildly financially independent because people would throw high-paying jobs at me that I could learn from, but I didn’t expect it to happen. Life isn’t <em>that</em> easy!</p>
Well… it happened.
</li>
<li>
<p>An <em>incredible</em> number of redacted things.</p>
<p>I’ve never been that kind of guy. Honest and innocent to a fault, no secrets except those arising from paranoid self-assigned concern about others’ privacy: that’s me. Until this year.</p>
<p>Oh well, I can’t blog about it.</p>
[redacted]
</li>
<li>
<p>But mostly, of course, I actually graduated. The teacher-appreciation dinner happened (6/4), where I debuted my graduation song (woo!) and ate some good cake (double woo!); senior prom happened (6/7), with some awesome photos; and then, actually, the graduation ceremony. (6/10, same day I realized I had recently passed 100 starred things on GitHub.)</p>
<p>::looks at self:: I’m actually a college student now.</p>
<p>Every one of these stages of life seems like it should be a big deal, like I should pass through and suddenly know all the things about maturity and aspirations and life that are expected of college students, but it never happens that way.</p>
At least, all things considered, I think this transition was very successful at taking my mind off the angsty side of things. This post is actually surprisingly unangsty. Sorry to disappoint if that’s what you’re here for!

<p>Well, there are better memory-triggering songs but I think this pretty much sums up how I feel about blogging right now (possibly including the very act of choosing that song.) And college apps. And life. Plus, the music video is silly in its own incredible way.</p>
<p>Anyway. Around this time a year ago, I made <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/time">a post</a> talking about how around a year before that,</p>
<blockquote>
I paused my participation in big high-school competitions, for a variety of reasons.
</blockquote>
<p>And then I rambled on life and programming competitions.</p>
<p>If you didn’t get it yet, this post so far has been written to meaningfully echo the last one. Nothing so abrupt has happened this year, but I just realized how nice it was to have a paragraph humorously listing the weird stuff I had gotten myself into over the course of 2013, so I’m going to do so again, even more completely.  (Broken into headers for easy skipping by people who don’t care for reading about certain categories.)</p>

	<p>Random video! Although I feel that I’ve heard it earlier, my first conscious memory of getting linked to it is from <a href="http://usamoarchive.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/youre-older-than-youve-ever-been/">this post</a>. At first I thought it would be the right background music for this post, but upon further reflection I think it mainly suited me while I was writing this post. Well, it’s topical if you mentally replace “day” with “year”.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/q2bo_u_YmW8" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
 </div>

<p>Anyway. Around this time a year ago, I paused my participation in big high-school competitions, for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, I stopped attempting to make IMO both because I wouldn’t get that much from the training and because other people ought to have the opportunity. I was concerned that I might condition myself to only be able to do math with the short-term motivation of contests. Better to focus on college math and maybe some original research, I thought. During the year, I did lots of the former and very little of the latter. Meh.</p>
<p>As for the IOI, my obvious next target: I was tired of training and going abroad while paranoid about whether my immune system would hold up. I didn’t feel that the IOI was worth that. To some degree, I also felt burned out about programming. Long story short, my treatment should end soon, and learning Haskell completely resolved the burnout problem.</p>
<p>But the most important reason, I think, was that “high school was too short”. I started math competitions ridiculously early and didn’t spend much time exploring other interests. I thought I knew myself well enough that I could say I didn’t have many more interests at all, but I was completely wrong (psych nerds will reflexively note this to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>). I coded lots in weird languages — Haskell, as mentioned previously, plus Scala, plus all manner of other magical command line tools. I wrote my first math problem and submitted it officially, picked up a new instrument, went to a debate competition, served as an unimportant tech guy for MUN, discovered and became hooked on Pentatonix, participated in three puzzle hunts in Australia and one in Massachusetts, figured out my rough political stance, rode a boat, got retweeted by <span class="citation" data-cites="eevee">@eevee</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Kyrgyzstan_News">@Kyrgyzstan_News</span>, increased my Neopets™ fortune by over 3400%, and lurked on FurAffinity a little too much.</p>
