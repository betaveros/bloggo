      <description>&lt;p&gt;At some point I thought, hmm, maybe this blog would benefit from some more sentimental, memory-capturing music/videos, like I chose for my &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/time&#34;&gt;end of 2013 post&lt;/a&gt; or my &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/rewind&#34;&gt;end of 2014 post&lt;/a&gt;. (Yeah, I link to my own posts alarmingly often. I think that’s kind of weird. I don’t know.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, because you’re reading this already, I decided to follow through with that idea. There’s no particular significance for posting this now — it’s not my birthday or anything, as the title might suggest; it just has a nice ring to it — except of course that I’m starting to get mildly desperate for content for my &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak exercise&lt;/a&gt;. Standard disclaimers apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mostly for my future self. I should note that, although I like these songs, this is not a list of my absolute most favorite songs ever. You can tell because there isn’t any Coldplay or fun. (the band.) Instead, each of these songs was chosen to be meaningful to myself and my life in at least two different ways that generally don’t overlap with the other songs. This was difficult but I think I managed it — you know, how constraint breeds creativity and everything? Also, they’re arranged by approximate chronological order of impact. But it also means that this list isn’t going to be that meaningful to anybody other than myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I have a long list of class-of-2015 sentimental songs, which I’m not including here because I think there are so many that they deserve a separate post. Will I avoid procrastinating and feeling awkward for long enough to make such a post? Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;shrugs&lt;/em&gt; Whatever, enjoy the music or stop reading now if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1: Simon &amp;amp; Garfunkel - Scarborough Fair/Canticle&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
  Not only is Scarborough Fair one of my mom’s favorite songs, I’ve bumped into it three entirely separate times while solving puzzles. I always love counterpoint and I find the effect here especially haunting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
