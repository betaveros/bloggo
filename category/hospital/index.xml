      <title>Last Step</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is more than slightly intimidating to go into the room through the big sliding door and see everybody dressed up in full-on green surgical garb with masks and hair nets. I don’t remember this part. Feeling a little vulnerable, I change my clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask to listen to my iPod during the operation — I remember being able to do this during the operation four long years ago when the subject of today’s surgery was inserted into my shoulder — but the nurse(?) says it’s best not to do that because they’ll be using something electric to stop the blood. Instead I can listen to music played from a computer in the operating room. Well, okay then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She escorts me through a bunch of twisty little passages to said room. The computer is a dual-screen Windows XP. The nurse shows me that there is a folder with random albums sorted by year. I poke through the folders and create a playlist in Windows Media Player interleaving &lt;cite&gt;1989&lt;/cite&gt; with a collection of classics from 五月天(Mayday). Then I get on the operating table and wait. One of the nurses compliments me on my choice of the latter band. A few tracks later, I deduce that my interleaving had been to no avail because the media player was set to shuffle. I spend a lot of time on the operating table at first not doing anything except stare at the ceiling. There is a white three-legged contraption there, with each hinged limb ending in a large blue-rimmed circle of surgical lights. There are white sans-serif letters inscribed on the rims, saying Chromophare® E 668 and Berch-something. I think the “something” was a synonym for “say” or “tell”. An after-the-fact search says it’s Berchtold. Typical human memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I am covered with lots of green cloth, which blocks out the ceiling. Instead, I can only see a clipboard and random paper forms on the left side of my peripheral vision, presumably propping up the cloth. The clipboard is a highly translucent pink. The form on top is yellow and has a box saying something about somebody paying; the form on bottom is white with a black-and-pink-striped right border. The clipboard’s clip also has random streaks of black marker across a white sticker.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t remember how long it had been since we entered the ninth floor. Somebody had covered the elevator area with cartoon animals and landscapes. Not surprising, since all the children’s wards were here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny idea, that: I am still a child for medical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not sick. Not more than usually, anyway. I didn’t need to get an IV drip installed or even change into the patient uniform the first night. There was nothing to do or feel. No guilt or fear, unlike last time — this check-up had been scheduled for along time and served as a simple test to see how my bone marrow was doing. No annoyance, either, because I knew it mattered; but no apprehension of the results, or of the needles. You can never get used to the needles, but you learn to just accept them anyway. There is nothing to be done about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows? The result could be something bad. But I know enough not to take this hypothetical seriously before it was anything other than hypothetical.&lt;/p&gt;
I slept, and dreamt of vomiting carrots. 
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fairy Tale</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: My 2011 self wrote this. It is selectively preserved for historical interest and amusement from a lot of similar, chronologically nearby posts. I am not as angsty any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know where to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First there was a headache. No biggie, sleep it off. But it’s easy to lose yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pain, the random gusts of nausea, confusion, irritation… it’s another person in this body, speaking a foreign language I can’t even begin to fathom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;playing by his own rules, won’t let you figure them out. his kingdom, and there’s not even a way to surrender or take the path of least resistance. Every path looks the same from here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blackness, vagueness, shadows, defying all interpretations&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Normality</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: My 2011 self wrote this. It is selectively preserved for historical interest and amusement from a lot of similar, chronologically nearby posts. That’s all. I am not as angsty any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. I was hoping I could blog for once without predictably explaining something about how this doesn’t mean anything about future posts or activity or anything, but apparently I can’t get started without a lame start like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight months have passed since I started my fight with leukemia. Yes it has been a rough eight months, full of unpredictable pain, nausea, diet restrictions, and freakishly-sized needles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been waiting for I don’t know how long for everything to go back to “normal”, but now that I look back I can no longer imagine the idea. The world, outside, still seems to be rushing at its insane pace towards maximum chaos. Economic and natural crises still seem to be always around the corner. But in here, in the hospital ward, or at home, it’s a really different feeling. I feel completely disconnected. Nothing changes; every day is waiting, waiting, waiting for the future, for a better moment or feeling or achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what, really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
