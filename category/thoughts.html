	<p>It feels a little surreal watching #DeleteFacebook.</p>
<p>On one hand, despite how hard it is to keep an issue trending in today’s fast news cycle, this issue has managed to continue burning for a while. Somewhat recently (March 21), we got two high-profile Facebook account deletions from <a href="https://twitter.com/brianacton/status/976231995846963201">Brian Acton (WhatsApp cofounder)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/23/elon-musk-deletes-own-spacex-and-tesla-facebook-pages-after-deletefacebook/">Elon Musk</a>. Other apparent examples include <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/03/28/playboy-dumps-facebook-amid-public-furor-over-users-data-leaks/465156002/">Playboy and Cher</a>, or see <a href="http://time.com/money/5220854/delete-facebook-celebrities-companies-cutting-ties-privacy/">Time</a> or <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/several-companies-and-people-are-pulling-back-from-facebook/">CNET</a> for a few more. Facebook’s U.S. and Canada user base <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/1/31/16957122/facebook-daily-active-user-decline-us-canda-q4-earnings-2018">declined for the first time last quarter</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for me and for a lot of people, the scandal just doesn’t seem that qualitatively different from things we’ve known about Facebook for a long time — its stance on privacy, its psychological effects, its willingness to manipulate the user experience. Why is this time different? (Here’s the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/87u9ro/why_is_everyone_all_of_a_sudden_mad_at_facebook/">/r/NoStupidQuestions thread.</a> I don’t actually know which answer I believe the most.)</p>
<p>Is this time really different? I’m not optimistic. The decline could simply be Facebook running out of potential users to add and space to grow. According to a recent Raymond James survey, about half of surveyed users did not plan to change how much they used Facebook, while only 8% would stop using it, and this may still be an overestimate of people who will actually leave or delete their accounts.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Mark Zuckerberg himself <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/mark-zuckerberg-q-and-a.html">told the New York Times</a>, “I don’t think we’ve seen a meaningful number of people act on [the #DeleteFacebook campaign]”.</p>
<p>I myself have to admit upfront that, even though I <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/me-and-facebook">barely use Facebook any more</a> and have carefully contemplated deleting my Facebook account for a long time, I still haven’t pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>Why? What will it take to change this?</p>

	<p><strong>tl;dr: I don’t use Facebook much. If you want to contact me, I would prefer nearly any other mode of communication. I am also going to stop autosharing posts from this blog onto Facebook. RSS readers are great; get yours today.</strong></p>
<p>Recently I checked Facebook and it said something like “You’ve added N friends this past T units of time! Thanks for making the world more connected!” and I just couldn’t any more. Facebook friends are not friends. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number">Dunbar’s number</a> is around 150, maybe double that if you want to stretch it; humans cannot handle that many human relationships. Facebook’s siloed ecosystem is the opposite of connected with the rest of the Internet.</p>
<p>That is one of many reasons I pretty much don’t use Facebook any more. This is not new, but I’ve never formalized it. Also, I figure others might assume otherwise since I still do have an account and still accept friend requests and post sometimes. Thus, I’m writing this post.</p>
<p>Here are all of the reasons:</p>

	<p>On November 8th, 2016, Donald Trump was elected the 45th President of the United States. Along with a Republican House and Senate majority, to boot.</p>
<p>The world around me is still hurting and reeling from the shock.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, I am scared. I am scared of the policies and executive orders and legal decisions to come that may strip away many civil rights and send the environment down a worse track faster than anyone expected, and I’m barely in any of the groups that have the most to lose. I have no idea what it’s like to go through this as any of you. I am sorry.</p>
<p>But I am also scared that this fear is driving my friends and my community away from talking to the people we need to talk to if we want to make sure this doesn’t happen again.</p>
<p>I’ve heard a lot of people vilify Trump and Trump supporters. <a href="https://nmnnmnnmmnnnmnrnmnmnnmn.wordpress.com/2016/11/09/1067/">Anecdotally, so have others</a>. It’s an understandable reaction, but a fragile one. 60 million people voted for Trump. <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/11/its-going-to-be-okay.html">Quoting <em>Wait But Why</em></a>, “[P]eople with kids and parents and jobs and dogs and calendars on their wall with piano lessons and doctors appointments and birthday parties written in the squares. Full, three-dimensional people who voted for what they hope will be a better future for themselves and their family.”</p>
<p>People voted for Trump. Why?</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-base-is-blue-collar-his-voters-looking-for-a-return-to-better-times/">FiveThirtyEight profiling a few blue-collar voters</a>. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/08/a-new-theory-for-why-trump-voters-are-so-angry-that-actually-makes-sense/">The Washington Post interviewing an author who spent a lot of time in rural Wisconsin</a>. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/us/politics/the-women-who-helped-donald-trump-to-victory.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur">The New York Times on women</a>. If the articles’ reasons for voting Trump could be summarized in one word, it would certainly be “economy”.</p>
<p>But then FiveThirtyEight tempers it a little bit with this reminder that <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/">Trump’s supporters are on average more well-off than others</a>. Here’s <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/11/george-saunders-goes-to-trump-rallies">The New Yorker visiting a bunch of Trump rallies</a>. SupChina discusses <a href="http://supchina.com/2016/11/03/many-first-generation-chinese-immigrants-supporting-donald-trump/">first-generation Chinese immigrants supporting Trump</a> and racism is a bullet point there, but apparently it’s partly rallied around rap lyrics about robbery that advise to “find a Chinese neighborhood” to steal from, so…? I am not going to go any deeper into this rabbit hole. Then here’s <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/03/trump-voters-are-not-angry-about-economy-really">Mother Jones arguing against the economy being a big factor at all</a>, and <a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/15/13286498/donald-trump-voters-race-economic-anxiety">Vox saying it <em>is</em> about racial resentment</a>. Here’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-11-11/revenge-of-the-deplorables">Bloomberg on the Clinton campaign’s failure to persuade</a> and <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2016/11/11/how-jon-stewart-and-the-daily-show-elected-donald-trump/">The Federalist on “hyper-liberal late-night comedy”</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/9/donald-trump-and-the-new-american-revolution/">The Washington Times on Trump’s optimism</a>. I could find hundreds more out there just by Googling, and so could you; and chances are if you’re enough of a voracious reader to be reading my humble blog, you’ve already read some of these.</p>

	I had this 5,000-word draft, but I half-abandoned it for being sappy, boring, pointless, and impossible to rewrite to be satisfactorily un-cringeworthy. Instead, let me just tell you a couple random stories and anecdotes that went somewhere near the start. Maybe posting them will motivate me to salvage something from the 4,500 words that go after it and post it. Eventually.
Some time ago, Namecheap had a discount, so I bought a domain name for 88¢.

	<p>I hate doing things under time pressure, but I have to admit I do a lot more things when time pressure exists. One of the things is writing. Another is posting the things I write. They aren’t very good, but they’re better than writing that doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>(in case you forgot, I’m still posting this pretty much only because <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/no-excuses">I made myself post once every weekend</a>)</p>
<p>It’s interesting that I can impose time pressure on myself by declaring commitment devices by fiat and it works. Other people have developed other methods of doing this — I recently discovered <a href="http://www.themostdangerouswritingapp.com/">The Most Dangerous Writing App</a>, which puts time pressure on you to type every five seconds or it deletes everything you wrote. There are many other ways it’s done.</p>

	<p>I have this memory —</p>
<p>I was a tiny kid, lying in bed and trying to fall asleep, and I started thinking about death and nonexistence, and I thought about how one day I wouldn’t exist any more, that there wouldn’t <em>be</em> a me thinking my thoughts and perceiving my perspective, and suddenly I was terrified.</p>
<p>I got up and knocked on my parents’ bedroom door and asked them about this. Maybe. Or maybe I didn’t because the fear was less crippling than the social awkwardness of randomly knocking on my parents’ door in the middle of the night to ask them a question like that; I don’t remember. It was a long time ago, okay?</p>

	<p>When I first made myself commit to posting weekly, I was trying to make myself spend a little time every day of the week thinking and writing and whittling away at old drafts. Instead I’m here at 10:40 PM basically starting a brand-new post. Oh well.</p>
<p>I last <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/music">blogged about music in 2013</a>. I tagged two other posts with “music” since then, but neither is particularly deep: <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/8-songs">8 Songs for 18 Years</a> and <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/drop-in">Drop-In Filler</a>. Let’s continue the tradition of self-analysis part IIs from nowhere…</p>
<hr />
<p>I meditated a little bit in <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/conversations">Conversations</a> about “lacking experience or interest in a lot of the commonly discussed culture.” I think this applies to me and music as well, although not as fully. Back in Taiwan, when mentally bracing myself for coming to the U.S. for college, I sometimes worried about not knowing enough about pop music and bands and not listening enough to popular albums, and having trouble integrating into the culture for this.</p>
<p>Turns out, among the communities I wandered into and friends I made, it was a more frequent obstacle that I didn’t know enough about classical music and composers. Whoops. Some of the names rang faint bells from either music class or conversations with high school friends who did do classical music, but I could not identify or remember any styles or eras, and would remember composers only by unreliable first letters or unusual substrings of their names.</p>

	<p>It’s another weekend, isn’t it.</p>
<p>I’m out of deep things to say. I don’t usually have deep things to say. Sorry to anybody who subscribed hoping for more things like the last post. This is basically going to be a personal stream of consciousness post. But it’s a stream with a long ancestry, since I apparently wrote 400 words about it in a WordPress draft four years ago. This was way back before I even started writing post drafts in Markdown on my computer instead of directly in WordPress, so I guess it must be an interesting topic.</p>
<p>Four years ago, Brian<sub>2012</sub> was suddenly struck by how many of the people he knew were such serious gamers. But let’s go back even earlier, shall we?</p>
<hr />
<p>A long long time ago, when I was in elementary school or so, my parents had some sort of reward system where I had to do productive things, like study or do chores or write diary entries or practice the piano or something, to earn time on the computer for games. “Gaming time” was a currency. I enjoyed saving up lots of thirty-minute increments and knowing I had the freedom to using them slowly.</p>
<p>That much I remember; the details of how it worked are very fuzzy and I’m not sure what I played in those thirty-minute increments either. I think there was Neopets and Runescape and Club Penguin. (My Neopets account still sees sporadic activity, because I get really really bored sometimes…)</p>

	<p>This post’s topic might be the most controversial thing I’ve posted here ever. I hope the points I want to make aren’t.</p>
<p>One of the excuses for not blogging I came up with and then deleted while <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/no-excuses">rambling about not blogging</a> was that I’m getting more feelings about real-world real-person issues, things that people take heated positions on — it’s not topics like what food I ate or what games I’m playing in fourth grade any more — and my identity is pretty public here, so who knows what’ll happen. Oh well. I’m probably just paranoid.</p>
<p>It’s also delayed, as the articles I’m talking about are old; the latest two news items are the shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile and then the police shooting at the Dallas rally. That was also really sad, but I don’t think I have anything insightful to say about it. Let me point you to the <a href="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/black-lives-matter">MIT Admissions post, “Black Lives Matter”</a>, and then for something a bit more optimistic out of a huge range of possible choices, <a href="https://medium.com/@Mandela/my-white-boss-talked-about-race-in-america-and-this-is-what-happened-fe10f1a00726#.wtnr99lp1">this Medium article</a>.</p>
<p>Although after I started writing this post, the story about <a href="http://www.indiatimes.com/news/world/muslim-man-hugs-isis-militant-armed-wearing-suicide-vest-before-explosion-saves-hundreds-of-lives-258126.html">a Muslim man preventing an ISIS suicide bomber</a> came out, so now this is mildly relevant again. Anyway, I guess the delay is no different from how I put up life posts weeks after the life event happens. So today, I bring you two old news articles about Islam that my friends shared and discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Green: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/todd-green-phd/is-islam-responsible-for-_b_10449060.html">Is Islam Responsible For The Orlando Nightclub Shooting?</a>
</li>
<li>
King: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/king-isis-terrorists-aren-muslims-evil-men-article-1.2699463">ISIS terrorists aren’t Muslims — they’re just evil men hell-bent on carnage and destruction</a>
</li>
</ul>
The second one first, whose argument is, to be frank, weak. I think this piece from <cite>The Atlantic</cite> by Wood, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/">“What ISIS Really Wants”</a>, is a better-researched overview of ISIS while still being pretty readable. One caveat is that it’s somewhat old. But its central claim is quite the opposite: 
<blockquote>
[The] Islamic State is Islamic. <em>Very</em> Islamic. … [T]he religion preached by its most ardent followers derives from coherent and even learned interpretations of Islam.
</blockquote>
<p>This is a long, long piece, so to get a feel for the evidence, here are some key quotes:</p>

	<p>One of the most unexpectedly different facets of life during my internship has been the meals.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about the food; it’s certainly different in a fantastic way (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/DropboxTuckShop/?fref=ts">Dropbox’s food (link to Facebook page)</a> is like something out of a high-end restaurant), but I knew that before coming already. Also of note is the way I started eating ∞% more ramen over the weekends than I did over the entire school year at MIT, because here I can’t buy that many groceries without them spoiling and am amazingly lazy in this new environment.</p>
<p>No, this (deadlined, so not that well-thought-out, but whatever) post is about conversations at meals, which happen basically every lunch and some dinners when my team eats together.</p>
<p>I’ve never had any regular experience like it. Of course I’ve had many meals at home with family, but they feel different because, well, it’s family and we have so many topics in common. I went to the same school for twelve years and we didn’t generally use a cafeteria; we just ate at our desks in our classrooms, or while doing things like attending club meetings or taking makeup tests. Sometimes if people felt like it they would push desks together to eat, but eating by oneself was totally normal. (At last, I feel like that was what it was. It seems so far away now that I don’t trust my memory, which is pretty sad… I faintly suspect I would have this experience in a more stereotypical American high school. But this is mostly just based off the cafeteria in <cite>Mean Girls</cite>, a movie I only watched in its entirety on the flight here, which is weird because I know I’ve seen the “The limit does not exist!” part much much earlier. /aside)</p>
