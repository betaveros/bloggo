	<p>Okay I don’t actually know how this pointless rambling got so long. I know the longer it is the more people will just tend to skim, because I do that all the time. So I went back and refactored—er, rewrote all the somewhat tangential bits (wow these puns are too easy) into footnotes. Manually. Obviously if I have to do this again I’ll write a script for it. But the post is still really long, and I bet nobody will read the whole thing. Oh well.</p>
<p>Life updates: I got out of the hospital Friday two-and-a-half weeks ago, went to the preliminaries of NPSC (a national team programming contest) with classmates, threw up a lot, went back into the hospital, and came out again. I wrote a lot of stuff about the experience and how much it sucked (hint: <em>a lot</em>) when I started this draft around that time, but now putting so much detail in this post feels weird. I’m mostly good now.</p>
<p>Three years ago NPSC was the only programming contest I really knew of; now I’ve participated in quite a few more, both online and locally, but it’s still the only contest I’ve entered that gives you real-time verdicts. I believe it inherits this from being modeled after ACM-ICPC, but that’s for college people and I’m less clear on how it works. All the other contests, namely <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/">TopCoder</a>, <a href="http://www.codeforces.com/">CodeForces</a>, <a href="http://usaco.org/">USACO</a>, and the other local individual competition (there doesn’t appear to be an English name so for the purpose of this post I’ll just call it “Nameless Local”; there’s a nation-wide competition in one-and-a-half weeks!), have system tests after the contest that don’t allow you to resubmit afterwards.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> They all give pretests that you get to know about right away, just to catch super-silly non-algorithmic mistakes like failing to remove the debug statements or reading input from the wrong place, but these contain weak test cases and don’t guarantee that the solution will pass the system tests and get full score.</p>

	Okay, I give up. Here it is: Gridderface is a (quoting the project description, which I wrote anyway so whatever) “keyboard inferface for marking grid-based puzzles in Java” that I’ve been working on for too long. It is open-source under the GPL v3.
Basically, it’s a thing you can paste logic puzzle images into to solve them in, like people do in Paint, when you can’t or don’t want to print them.

	<p>Okay did I mention how I sucked at the command line? This is part of the journey towards stopping. Yes, I’m on a Mac and it’s not very *nix-y in some ways but it’s enough for me for now.</p>
<p>Today’s story starts when I learned about <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/"><code>gdb</code></a>, the pure-command-line GNU Debugger, which is incredibly cool. I have tried and failed to learn how to use the debug function on many of my IDEs; I found shotgunning <code>printf</code> statements as needed faster. This may well be the first time I found a command-line tool so much more intuitive than the GUI-equipped programs. Wow.</p>
<p>Then I learned that for some reason the <code>gdb</code> on this computer was 6.3, which is 1.2~1.5 major versions behind (depending on how you count) and missing a frustrating amount of features. (The one that the current Code::Blocks installer installs is also something like 6.4. Blech.)</p>

<p>Hardware:</p>
<p>The laptop I’m typing this on is over two years old. This is not a lot by some measures, but weird spontaneous glitches are starting to accumulate to the point where they’re getting on my nerves. The internet card still needs an extra reset to start working half the time, and occasionally warrants a full reboot, which costs five minutes. The USB ports are loopy, some windows just show up black when they feel like it, and there’s a steadily climbing whir in the background. I’m kind of anticipating the moment the whole thing just drops dead.</p>
<p>Well, I’m not about to run out of computers to use (there’s a noisy XP desktop that also barely works despite handling all our print jobs, but also one spanking new eight-core CPU laptop, which Dad considered a valuable enough investment (?)) but such a loss is still not something to be dismissed lightly. And the externalized cost is far more important and chilling. Who knows how many kids in the Congo had to mine coltan, or how much conflict has occurred over the crude oil, or what awful conditions those sweatshop-assembly workers are going through? Annie Leonard’s words still resonate with me from when we were first shown the video a year ago. Which is more recent than this laptop, so that doesn’t mean that much. I think a couple months ago I would have absolutely no second thoughts about getting a new one, though. Yup, I’m in a quandary (ha ha vocabulary) on the balance between desensitization and compulsive hoarding of stuff.</p>

	There are two big elementary and middle school competitions around this part of the globe. Well, “big” according to “I’ve heard of it”, which is by no means an accurate measure of, well, anything. I don’t go out of my way to look for them any more, even though… hold on, am I still eligible? Whatever. But in any case, diverting any unnecessary energy from the olympiad-proof-training is probably not a good idea now.

	<p><code><a href="https://diagrams.github.io/">diagrams</a></code> is a nifty Haskell library for making vector diagrams. I keep coming back to it to generate graphics for puzzles:</p>
<ul>
<li>the very old <a href="https://blog.vero.site/post/signature-puzzle">A Signature Puzzle</a> from this blog</li>
<li><a href="https://dp.puzzlehunt.net/puzzle/a-fork-in-the-road.html">A Fork in the Road</a> (DP Puzzle Hunt)</li>
<li><a href="https://2020.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/symbols">Symbols</a> (Galactic Puzzle Hunt 2020)</li>
<li><a href="https://silphpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/a-lot-of-research">A Lot of Research into Things That Have Very Little Meaning</a> (Silph Puzzle Hunt)</li>
</ul>
<p>I got sick of relearning it every time, and I think there’s some small chance other people will find it useful too, so I wrote something up. This post is a sort of reference that tries to compromise between the <a href="https://diagrams.github.io/doc/quickstart.html">quick start tutorial</a> and <a href="https://diagrams.github.io/doc/manual.html">manual</a> on one hand, and the API reference on the other, to try to be deeper and more comprehensive than the former, but also flow better and be easier to navigate than the latter. Some types are just really intimidating when fully written out…</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="ot">circle ::</span> (<span class="dt">TrailLike</span> t, <span class="dt">V</span> t <span class="op">~</span> <span class="dt">V2</span>, <span class="dt">N</span> t <span class="op">~</span> n, <span class="dt">Transformable</span> t) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> n <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> t</a></code></pre></div>
<p>To avoid unhelpfully generic types, I will deal concretely with two-dimensional diagrams that measure everything in <code>Double</code>, and will frequently abbreviate complex types with an asterisk, like I will write <code>V2*</code> for <code>V2 Double</code>. I will introduce these aliases along the way for easy greppability. They’re not legal Haskell, of course.</p>
<p>This reference assumes basic-to-intermediate Haskell knowledge. Some of the more intermediate stuff includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monoids, and that the Haskell <code>Monoid</code> operator is <code>&lt;&gt;</code></li>
<li>Typeclasses. I will sometimes write fake type signatures as abbreviations for typeclass restrictions: for example, <code>TrailLike</code> is a typeclass, and I might say or write that a function returns <code>TrailLike</code> when I really mean <code>TrailLike t =&gt; t</code>, any type <code>t</code> that is in that typeclass.</li>
</ul>
<p>van Laarhoven lenses may help, but mostly I’ll try to black-box them.</p>

	<p>It seems like a rite of passage to create one of these because there are so many Coq tactic cheat sheets out there and there’s just so much to learn. Here’s mine.</p>
<p>This is mostly about tactics but I realized not really.</p>
<p>Links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://coq.inria.fr/refman/proof-engine/tactics.html">Coq Tactics</a>. Authoritative but dense.</li>
<li><a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/index.html">Logical Foundations</a> (Software Foundations Volume 1). I think the order of ideas makes pedagogical sense but also makes it hard for me to look up particular tactics or concepts.</li>
<li><p>Other Coq cheat sheets found by Googling “Coq cheat sheets”:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pjreddie.com/coq-tactics/">Coq Tactics Index</a> (Joseph Redmon)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2018sp/a5/coq-tactics-cheatsheet.html">Coq Tactics Cheatsheet</a> (Cornell CS3110)</li>
<li><a href="http://adam.chlipala.net/itp/tactic-reference.html">Coq Tactics Quick Reference</a> (Adam Chlipala) / the <a href="http://adam.chlipala.net/frap/">Formal Reasoning About Programs</a> book also has a nice appendix</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~rrand/popl_2016/reference.html">Coq Tactics</a> (UPenn ???)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Meta-notes: I cover a lot of weak tactics because I like knowing exactly what my tools are doing. I try to use the variants of tactics that explicitly name things produced when possible. I am sure there is nomenclature I don’t understand precisely and use sloppily in this list; I am also sloppy with metavariables. Even things that are correct might be horrible style. There are likely other errors and omissions. They might be fixed one day. I’m putting this up nevertheless because it’s personally useful.</p>
<h3 id="things-i-wish-i-knew-but-didnt-learn-from-software-foundations-or-coq-tactic-cheat-sheets">Things I wish I knew but didn’t learn from Software Foundations or Coq tactic cheat sheets</h3>
<ul>
<li>The first two sections are not about tactics per se but how to find theorems to use and how to use them. Knowing how to use all of these query commands is super useful.</li>
<li>To clean up repeating subexpressions with “local variables”, I find <code>remember expr as X eqn:Hname.</code> easier to work with than <code>set (X := expr).</code></li>
<li><code>pose proof expr as Hname.</code> adds <code>expr</code> to the context, with name <code>Hname</code>. Modus ponens where you know <code>H1</code> and <code>H2</code>, which is “<code>H1</code> implies <code>H3</code>”, is just <code>pose proof (H2 H1) as H3</code>.</li>
<li>Software Foundations covers bullets and curly braces early, but I like subgoal specification with <code>1:</code>, <code>2:</code> etc., which can really help limit nesting depth. <code>2: (tactic that solves subgoal 2).</code> If you want more bullets, there are infinitely many, not just three. After <code>-</code> <code>+</code> <code>*</code> you can use <code>--</code> <code>++</code> <code>**</code> <code>---</code> etc.</li>
</ul>

	<p><a href="http://www.brucelindbloom.com/">Bruce Lindbloom</a> has a ton of equations, but I just want the big ones on one page. We’ll assume <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a>, which implies using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminant_D65">D65</a> as white (if you’re using Bruce Lindbloom’s calculator to check your implementation, make sure to set these).</p>
<h3 id="rgb-linear-rgb">RGB ↔ Linear RGB</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\Xi\)</span> (one of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>) be an RGB component in the range <span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span>. (This is an obnoxious variable choice, but I’m trying to not overload any variable names in this entire post.) If you have RGB values in <span class="math inline">\([0, 255]\)</span>, divide them by 255. It can be converted to/from the <strong>linearized component</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> (one of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>) as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\xi = \begin{cases} \Xi/12.92 &amp; \text{if }\Xi \leq 0.04045 \\ ((\Xi + 0.055)/1.055)^{2.4} &amp; \text{if }\Xi &gt; 0.04045 \end{cases}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Xi = \begin{cases} 12.92\xi &amp; \text{if }\xi \leq 0.0031308 \\ 1.055v^{1/2.4} - 0.055 &amp; \text{if }\xi &gt; 0.0031308 \end{cases}\]</span></p>
<p>This is called “companding”.</p>
<p>However, you can use <span class="math inline">\(\xi = \Xi^{2.4}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Xi = \xi^{1/2.4}\)</span> in a pinch.</p>
<h3 id="linear-rgb-xyz">Linear RGB ↔ XYZ</h3>
<p>Convert between XYZ and linearized RGB. Again, this assumes sRGB and D65.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
X &amp;= 0.4124564r + 0.3575761g + 0.1804375b \\
