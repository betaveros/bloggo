      <title>Proprietary Format</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The villains are communicating with their own proprietary file format. Figure out what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ nc proprietary.ctfcompetition.com 1337&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get a server that will talk to us on a port and a &lt;code&gt;flag.ctf&lt;/code&gt; file that’s definitely not a binary. It’s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box&#34;&gt;black-box&lt;/a&gt; reversing challenge! I was @-mentioned as the person who might want to due to solving bananaScript (CSAW CTF Quals 2017) as a black box, although that gave a binary that it was possible in theory to reverse. Here black-box reversing is the only option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first few lines of input that the server wants, it responds with quite helpful error messages to help you appease it. If the first line you give it is not &lt;code&gt;P6&lt;/code&gt;, it complains:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cat Chat</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You discover this cat enthusiast chat app, but the annoying thing about it is that you’re always banned when you start talking about dogs. Maybe if you would somehow get to know the admin’s password, you could fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This challenge is a simple chat app written in NodeJS. The home page redirects you to a chat room labeled with a random UUID. Anybody can join the same chat room with the URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/cat-chat-0.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fresh Cat Chat room&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a chat room, you can chat and issue two commands, &lt;code&gt;/name&lt;/code&gt; to set your name and &lt;code&gt;/report&lt;/code&gt; to report that somebody is talking about dogs. After anybody in the chat room issues &lt;code&gt;/report&lt;/code&gt;, the admin shows up, listens for a while, and bans anybody who mentions the word “dog”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two more commands, &lt;code&gt;/secret&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/ban&lt;/code&gt;, which are in the server source code and also described in comments in the HTML source if you didn’t notice:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JS Safe 2.0</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/js-safe-2</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You stumbled upon someone’s “JS Safe” on the web. It’s a simple HTML file that can store secrets in the browser’s localStorage. This means that you won’t be able to extract any secret from it (the secrets are on the computer of the owner), but it looks like it was hand-crafted to work only with the password of the owner…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge consists of a fancy HTML file with a cute but irrelevant animated cube and some embedded JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/js-safe-2-empty.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of JS Safe 2.0 with a text box and a cube&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The hardest challenge of not very many I solved in this CTF. What a struggle! I have a long way to improve. It was pretty fun though. (I solved “You Already Know”, and got the essence of “ghettohackers: Throwback”, but didn’t guess the right flag format and believe I was asleep when they released the hint about it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge consists of a simple PHP script that opens a MySQL connection and then feeds our input into a custom PHP extension &lt;code&gt;shellme.so&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode php&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode php&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;1&#34; href=&#34;#1&#34; data-line-number=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;$link&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;mysqli_connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;localhost&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shellql&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shellql&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shellql&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;2&#34; href=&#34;#2&#34; data-line-number=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;3&#34; href=&#34;#3&#34; data-line-number=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;isset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;$_POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shell&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;4&#34; href=&#34;#4&#34; data-line-number=&#34;4&#34;&gt;{&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;5&#34; href=&#34;#5&#34; data-line-number=&#34;5&#34;&gt;   &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;strlen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;$_POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shell&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;= &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;6&#34; href=&#34;#6&#34; data-line-number=&#34;6&#34;&gt;   {&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;7&#34; href=&#34;#7&#34; data-line-number=&#34;7&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;$_POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shell&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;8&#34; href=&#34;#8&#34; data-line-number=&#34;8&#34;&gt;      shellme&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;$_POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;st&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;shell&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;9&#34; href=&#34;#9&#34; data-line-number=&#34;9&#34;&gt;   }&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;10&#34; href=&#34;#10&#34; data-line-number=&#34;10&#34;&gt;   &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;11&#34; href=&#34;#11&#34; data-line-number=&#34;11&#34;&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension basically just executes &lt;code&gt;$_POST[&#39;shell&#39;]&lt;/code&gt; as shellcode after a strict SECCOMP call, &lt;a href=&#34;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html&#34;&gt;prctl&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.16.8/source/include/uapi/linux/prctl.h#L68&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.1/source/include/uapi/linux/seccomp.h#L10&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). This means that we can only use the four syscalls &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;exit&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;sigreturn&lt;/code&gt;, where the latter two aren’t particularly useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/shell_this.png&#34; alt=&#34;Disassembled innermost function of interest in shellme.so&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Disassembled innermost function of interest in &lt;code&gt;shellme.so&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to read the flag from the open MySQL connection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Messy Desk</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/messy-desk</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/messy-desk</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This challenge is a video of somebody’s messy desk, with what is apparently the audio from a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwnI0RS6J5A&#34;&gt;Futurama clip&lt;/a&gt;. The desk is indeed extremely messy and full of things that aren’t particularly useful for us, but close examination reveals a QR code reflected in the globe in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is all about getting that QR code. After trying our best to clean up the image, we ended up with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/messy-qr.png&#34; alt=&#34;Maximally enhanced image of the QR code&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Maximally enhanced image of the QR code&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      <title>Pupper/Doggo</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/doggo</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 May 2018 13:52:52 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/doggo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are presented with a big zip file of SML code, which implements an interpreter for a small ML-like language with a form of taint analysis in its type checker, called &lt;em&gt;Wolf&lt;/em&gt;. Concretely, every type in Wolf’s type system has an associated &lt;em&gt;secrecy&lt;/em&gt;: it is either “private” or “public”, and in theory, the type system makes it impossible to do any computation on private data to get a public result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a CTF, so the challenge is all about breaking the theoretical guarantees of the type system. When we submit code, it’s evaluated in a context with a private integer variable &lt;code&gt;flag&lt;/code&gt;; our code is typechecked, executed, and printed, but only if its type is public. The goal is to break the type system and write code that produces a public value that depends on &lt;code&gt;flag&lt;/code&gt;, so that we can exfiltrate &lt;code&gt;flag&lt;/code&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, there are three progressively harder Wolf problems, named Pupper, Doggo, and Woofer. Doggo and Woofer are each encrypted with the flag of the challenge before it, so that you need to solve them in order (unless you can somehow blindly exploit servers running SML programs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wolf-overview&#34;&gt;Wolf Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s first go over the Wolf syntax and semantics. (There are small differences between the three problems, but they’re syntactically identical and only semantically differ in cases that we’ll naturally get to.) The &lt;code&gt;examples&lt;/code&gt; folder has some examples of valid code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode ml&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode ocaml&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;1&#34; href=&#34;#1&#34; data-line-number=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; x = (&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; :&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;2&#34; href=&#34;#2&#34; data-line-number=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Okay, this post is backdated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disassembling the executable produces a huge amount of code. There are some basic obfuscations like a lot of trivial identity functions nested in each other, and a few functions that wrap around identity functions but just add some constant multiple of 16. Most of the meat is in one very large function, though. If you disassemble this function with IDA, you see a lot of variable initializations and then a lot of interesting loops that are quite similar:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoroughly Stripped</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/thoroughly-stripped</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Woo, first CTF writeup. I got the opportunity to participate in the 2017 CSAW CTF finals with Don’t Hack Alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dumped by my core, left to bleed out bytes on the heap, I was stripped of my dignity… The last thing I could do was to let other programs strip me of my null-bytes just so my memory could live on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are provided with a core dump. Examining the flavor-text and the dump, we notice that the dump has no null bytes; we conjecture that they have been stripped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we examine the hexdump and look for any clues. There are a bunch of ASCII strings, but they look like normal debugging symbols. One thing that jumps out is that there are a couple fairly convincing regular striped patterns that become vertically aligned if you display 20 bytes in each line. Once we do that, we notice the following section. (This dump is from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/betaveros/xxb&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;xxb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but &lt;code&gt;xxd -c 20 thoroughlyStripped&lt;/code&gt; is quite sufficient.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jam-Packed Fun and Games</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/jam</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/jam</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did I say “fun”? That was short for function calls. Which are fun too, admittedly. Blah, I always go to such lengths to come up with snappy yet justified post titles and end up achieving neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more complimentary breakfast later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Code Jam World Finals. &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/nametag.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/nametag.jpg?w=170&#34; alt=&#34;[Google Code Jam 2015 name tag with my name and handle and country]&#34; width=&#34;170&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3374&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Let me take a moment to reflect. Seriously. I do not know how I made it this far this year. I guess I might be a top-500-ish competitive programmer globally, maybe even top-150-ish, but definitely not top-25-ish. And &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/4254486/dashboard#s=p3&#34;&gt;Log Set&lt;/a&gt;, the hard problem that got me through Round 3, doesn’t seem like it plays to my forte particularly either. It’s a bit mathy, but the math bits aren’t the hard part; I think it’s largely implementation, with one psychological hurdle where you have to realize that, because of how few distinct integers there are in S′, you can efficiently solve the subset-sum instances you need to produce the lexicographically earliest answer. I’m actually kind of impressed I got that. It seems like the sort of hurdle I usually get stuck on. How did this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe randomness. Maybe I was just particularly clear-minded during the round and wrote less buggy code than usual, because I had no expectation of making it whatsoever and so could look at the contest detachedly (until midway through the contest I accidentally noticed that my rank was under 20, and even then I tried very very hard not to think about it, and it kind of worked).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it happened, and now I’m here. Time to roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some emails much earlier in the Code Jam logistical process, Google had asked for “requests for changes and/or additions” to the software that would be installed on our competition computers, and I had sent them a long list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;br /&gt; Here are some things I’d like if they were installed, in decreasing order of priority:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The Vim plugin syntastic ( https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic )
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
a Haskell compiler (probably Haskell Platform 2014.2.0.0 https://www.haskell.org/platform/ even though it’s a year old)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
the Haskell package hdevtools ( https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hdevtools ) so that the above two may be integrated
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
(I don’t have enough Linux experience to name a specific thing to install, but command-line utilities that are the equivalent of pbcopy and pbpaste on Mac OS X, which allow me to redirect text into or out of the clipboard from the command line easily)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Of course, this is my first Code Jam and I don’t know how reasonable these requests are. Any nontrivial subset would be appreciated.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <description>Nope, still no meaningful post today. Instead here is a pretty diagram of the A* search algorithm (A-star in English, for my search crawler overlords). At least, I hope it is; I spent more time fiddling with the pretty colors than making sure the algorithm I implemented was actually A*. It looks right, though? In the background, red component measures traversed distance from start, (inverted) green component measures difference between the traversed distance plus heuristic distance and the theoretically optimal heuristic distance from the start, blue component measures heuristic distance to goal.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr: anybody want to add me on Line or tell/remind me about other phone chat apps? betaveros as always.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, talk about uninspired post titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a new phone today. Or, well, it’s second-hand, actually. I try to make electronics last a long time, but I think this was justified given the state of my last phone’s screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/screen.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/screen.jpg?w=269&#34; alt=&#34;old phone screen, with a visibly malfunctioning black patch&#34; width=&#34;269&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3142&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, I’m going off to college and all. Anyway, the phone is pretty cool. It’s a slick shade of red, it came with a cover and everything, and it has one of those fancy 3x3-grid locks. How secure are those again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we could just &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6979524/android-lock-password-combinations&#34;&gt;find the answer on StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s boring.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Okay, I think I’m figuring this out. When I make a filler post for the streak, it should be an unabashed filler post, so I can accumulate some of the blogging time I find each day to work on a serious post (and for doing the other important stuff I should be doing!) instead of wasting it right away.
Life. I’m programming something for Dad involving a parser using Jison, and one of the tasks involved stuffing a custom lexer into the parser.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Frivolous blog content, posted as part of a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak I have openly committed to&lt;/a&gt;; standard disclaimers apply)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of boredom and curiosity, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://betaveros.github.io/bars-college.html&#34;&gt;graphed how many emails colleges sent me&lt;/a&gt;, excluding the colleges I actually applied to. I am being extremely polite and just calling them emails. I’ve wanted to make this for a long time, but it wasn’t until I saw this &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/message/my-failed-experiment-in-time-travel-3aa2240a6bc0&#34;&gt;post about an email experiment&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://waxy.org/links/&#34;&gt;waxy.org/links&lt;/a&gt; that I understood which tools I could use to quantify my emails. (And then I actually made it and procrastinated posting it here for two months. If you look at my GitHub page or activity you might have seen it already, though. Oops.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the results were expected. Other than saying that, I leave the interpretation up to the reader because I’m on a tight blogging schedule. Cool? Cool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

5:27 PM &lt;strong&gt;phenomist&lt;/strong&gt;: do you use gridderface to make pretty puzzles?&lt;br /&gt;
…&lt;br /&gt;
5:52 PM &lt;strong&gt;phenomist&lt;/strong&gt;: actually nvm excel is probably easier lol
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay I’m sorry this is a horrible puzzle where the rules don’t make sense and I didn’t even get it testsolved. I just wanted an image to concisely demonstrate the capabilities of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/betaveros/gridderface&#34;&gt;gridderface&lt;/a&gt;, my puzzle marking and creation program, for the project homepage, after somebody expressed interest in using the program to write a puzzle. Then I got tremendously carried away.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>C/C&#43;&#43; to D</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/c-to-d</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/c-to-d</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m assuming you want to use D largely, but not entirely, for competitive programming. That’s me right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;basics&#34;&gt;Basics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syntax is very similar. Function definitions, semicolon-terminated statements, variable declarations, and so on. You can declare &lt;code&gt;int main() {...}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;void main() {...}&lt;/code&gt; or something with arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic types like &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; are all there. Wonderfully, &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; is 64 bits. Instead of &lt;code&gt;unsigned&lt;/code&gt; whatever, just prefix a &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;, e.g. &lt;code&gt;uint&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arithmetic operators and bit operators are all there too, including unsigned right shift &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Although &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; is still xor, D has exponentiation as &lt;code&gt;^^&lt;/code&gt;. Sadly, &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; is still same-sign remainder; there’s no true mod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode d&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode d&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;1&#34; href=&#34;#1&#34; data-line-number=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; std.stdio;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casts look like &lt;code&gt;cast(int) x;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;control-flow&#34;&gt;Control Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;, and even &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; all work as you’d expect, along with &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; is the nice addition though. Not only can you iterate over arrays and stuff, but range loops go like:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post was written in Traditional Mandarin Chinese for my fellow competitive programmers in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hoj.twbbs.org/judge/problem/view/226&#34;&gt;題目在這裡，HOJ 226&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有關的題目出現於NPSC 2014 高中組決賽pD。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;前置要求：treap (split, merge)跟在上面實作區段操作（請參考資訊枝幹）。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;這裡沒有完整的解答code，因為AC是要用血汗換來的才值得 :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;treap&#34;&gt;Treap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我討厭單字母&lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;的變數名稱（跟&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;太像了。我沒有被這個雷過，這只是自己對自己程式碼可讀性的要求），所以我的子樹叫做&lt;code&gt;lc&lt;/code&gt;(left child)，&lt;code&gt;rc&lt;/code&gt;(right child)。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode cpp&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode cpp&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;1&#34; href=&#34;#1&#34; data-line-number=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; Treap {&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;7&#34; href=&#34;#7&#34; data-line-number=&#34;7&#34;&gt;};&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;10&#34; href=&#34;#10&#34; data-line-number=&#34;10&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; pull(Treap * a) {&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>[IOI 2014 Part 2] One Line to Solve Them All</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/one-line</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/one-line</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started trying to sleep at 9 the night before the contest, tossed and turned in bed until 10, then fell asleep and got up at 3:35 in the morning. Blah. At that point, I went to the bathroom and applied some chapstick before trying to go back to sleep until 6. After breakfast, I grabbed a few minutes of sleep on the bus to the convention center where our contest would be, then slept on a sofa outside the actual contest hall alongside most of the rest of our team as we waited for a very long time until it was okay for us to enter. Competitions really mess with one’s sleep schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, much too soon, we could enter. Day 1 of the contest was about to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laptops were as yesterday, although they were protected with a white screensaver that indicated my name and ID as well as a countdown to the start of the contest. I was glad to see that my mousepad and all my writing utensils had survived without me. Somebody had the sense of humor to project an online stopwatch with an animated bomb fuse onto the screens to indicate the remaining time, which, once again, there was a lot of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I conferred briefly with Paul (TZW (alphaveros (?))) about vim settings for a bit, but there were still fifteen minutes left or so. I idly stretched, practiced typing my &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; on an imaginary keyboard, and watched as the US dude two tables to my left unplugged his laptop’s mouse and rearranged absolutely everything on his table using the surface under his chair as swap space. (Well, that was how I mentally described it at the time, pending further revelations. (hint hint))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it began. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know day 1 of the contest already ended and is probably a more interesting topic to blog about, but I finished writing this last night just before the internet was cut off to quarantine the contestants from the leaders, who received the problems and began translating them. I didn’t know about this until it was too late, which is why I’ve been waiting since yesterday to post this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide a counterpoint to the last post, one of the many, &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; advantages of entering an international competition is that you get to meet a lot more people you already know, so there’s less time spent being socially awkward. While waiting for stuff to happen, aside from all the expected time spent with the Taiwan team, I also talked to, played games with, and otherwise entertained a whole lot of people I already knew, including my schoolmates (no less than fourteen of them were volunteers) and some of the college students who had shepherded us around during olympiad training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is a good thing, too, because there was a lot of waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I waited for my teammates; my parents had decided to take me to the hotel (Fullon Shenkeng) directly, since I had a lot of stuff, and I had arrived early. This took about an hour, after which we had lunch. Then I waited for the hotel to give us our room cards, which took about five hours, after which we had dinner. Finally, at night, I waited for the Codeforces system tests. Very nerve-wracking. But I’m getting ahead of myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Late post. As usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with an online competition — write programs, solve problems, get points. I wouldn’t call the problems easy, but they weren’t hard either. So I solved all of them. To make it even less impressive, only about twenty people submitted anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the result was just what it was: I ended up with a free ticket to &lt;a href=&#34;https://tw.pycon.org/2014apac/en/&#34;&gt;PyCon APAC 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the first stage of selection camp, I was very nervous because I was fifth place in a selection sequence that would finally result in a team of four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I screwed myself over on the first mock test by committing to a bad implementation method on a problem that was hard to get points on. My method seemed simple, but the memory usage leaked out in a way that was confusing and hard to patch; unfortunately, I tried to patch it in increasingly desperate and convoluted ways rather than scrapping the method, and thus missed out on many of the points elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the second test I failed to read the last problem carefully and spent too much of my time on the second problem, once again missing out on a lot of relatively easy points. I had optimized and optimized and pushed my quadratic runtime down to linearithmic, which would allow me to get the points for the last subtask — or so I thought. But with 10 minutes left I had all but one testcase right, and after desperately rereading my code, I realized that I had a string comparison stuck in an inner loop that could make my runtime degenerate to quadratic if the input string had lots of the same digit. In order to have a solidly linearithmic algorithm, I would have to implement a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_array&#34;&gt;suffix array&lt;/a&gt;. Ten minutes? I gave up. (The problem setters told me afterwards that hashing would have worked too; I didn’t think of that at all. Oops.) I spent the 10 minutes reading the last problem and still failed to read it carefully. So that did not go very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as the title probably gave away, during the third and fourth mock tests everything went much better than expected. :)  There are two good reasons:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adventures in Cabal Installations</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/cabal</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/cabal</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First Google Code Jam!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format of this competition, allowing us to run programs on our own machines, brought up a very interesting issue for me: what programming language should I be using? (I had had similar considerations for IPSC 2013, but GCJ’s problems are closer to the traditional ACM-ICPC style.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious choice is C++, the language I use for roughly every other competition, but its safety (or lack thereof) is not very appealing. I need speed, but not &lt;em&gt;that much&lt;/em&gt; speed. Unfortunately I still haven’t gotten around to learning any other friendlier mid-level languages (on the list: D, Go, or Rust), so I have no close substitutes for C++ right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is certainly available for a reliable arbitrary-length integer type, if nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for non-candidates, Java has &lt;code&gt;BigInteger&lt;/code&gt; and memory safety, but all in all I decided the benefits are too minor and it’s too ugly without operator overloading. Scala is probably way too slow. So I don’t expect to be writing either language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only difficult choice I have to make is, of course, Haskell — which can be quite fast, even while it’s ridiculously type-safe and expressive and referentially transparent and easy to reason about, once you’ve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;figured out how to do the problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scrapped step 1 and &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; figured out how to do the problem &lt;em&gt;functionally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gotten the thing to compile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I can handle step 1, step 2 is by no means a simple task, as my struggle to implement a mere &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/haskell&#34;&gt;Sieve of Eratosthenes&lt;/a&gt; efficiently shows. That is fun, but not at all intuitive; I am doubtful I can do this under contest conditions. It is extremely difficult to transfer my skills in learning how to implement, say, a segment tree or treap into this language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But! Google links to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.go-hero.net/jam/10/round/0&#34;&gt;programming language breakdown for 2010 Qualification Round&lt;/a&gt; as an example, and much to my surprise, Haskell ranks somewhere between sixth and tenth place in popularity (depending on what you sort by), so there are functional superprogrammers who can presumably do something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, I ended up implementing all four solutions to the qualification rounds in Haskell, because of the relaxed time limit and lack of any involved algorithms and data structures. I think it was worth it. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Random video! Although I feel that I’ve heard it earlier, my first conscious memory of getting linked to it is from &lt;a href=&#34;http://usamoarchive.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/youre-older-than-youve-ever-been/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. At first I thought it would be the right background music for this post, but upon further reflection I think it mainly suited me while I was writing this post. Well, it’s topical if you mentally replace “day” with “year”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/q2bo_u_YmW8&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34; title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Around this time a year ago, I paused my participation in big high-school competitions, for a variety of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I stopped attempting to make IMO both because I wouldn’t get that much from the training and because other people ought to have the opportunity. I was concerned that I might condition myself to only be able to do math with the short-term motivation of contests. Better to focus on college math and maybe some original research, I thought. During the year, I did lots of the former and very little of the latter. Meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the IOI, my obvious next target: I was tired of training and going abroad while paranoid about whether my immune system would hold up. I didn’t feel that the IOI was worth that. To some degree, I also felt burned out about programming. Long story short, my treatment should end soon, and learning Haskell completely resolved the burnout problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most important reason, I think, was that “high school was too short”. I started math competitions ridiculously early and didn’t spend much time exploring other interests. I thought I knew myself well enough that I could say I didn’t have many more interests at all, but I was completely wrong (psych nerds will reflexively note this to be the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect&#34;&gt;Dunning-Kruger effect&lt;/a&gt;). I coded lots in weird languages — Haskell, as mentioned previously, plus Scala, plus all manner of other magical command line tools. I wrote my first math problem and submitted it officially, picked up a new instrument, went to a debate competition, served as an unimportant tech guy for MUN, discovered and became hooked on Pentatonix, participated in three puzzle hunts in Australia and one in Massachusetts, figured out my rough political stance, rode a boat, got retweeted by &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34; data-cites=&#34;eevee&#34;&gt;@eevee&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34; data-cites=&#34;Kyrgyzstan_News&#34;&gt;@Kyrgyzstan_News&lt;/span&gt;, increased my Neopets™ fortune by over 3400%, and lurked on FurAffinity a little too much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
“I have been told that any encryption becomes safer if the underlying algorithm is maximally obscured, what is most conveniently done by coding it in Haskell.” – rankk
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional programming is terribly addicting! Partly I think the completely different way of thinking makes it feel like learning programming, and falling in love with it, all over again. Partly there’s this evil sense of satisfaction from using &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;s (and later &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;$&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code&gt;=&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;s) to improve readability for initiated Haskellers and worsen it for everybody else. Partly it’s because &lt;a href=&#34;http://learnyouahaskell.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is such a fun read — there are too many funny bits to list but my favorite so far is when the author analyzes the first verse of Avril Lavigne’s &lt;em&gt;Girlfriend&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I think my code in Haskell tends to be more readable than in other languages, code obfuscation in Haskell is almost natural: all you have to do is refactor the wrong function to be “pointfree”, which means that even though it’s a function that takes arguments, you define it without parameters by manipulating and joining a bunch of other functions. Example (plus a few other tiny obfuscations):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;1&#34; href=&#34;#1&#34; data-line-number=&#34;1&#34;&gt;isPrime &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; liftA2 (&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;) (liftA2 (&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;) (all &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; ((&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;) (&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;/=&lt;/span&gt;)) &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; rem) (flip&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;2&#34; href=&#34;#2&#34; data-line-number=&#34;2&#34;&gt;    takeWhile [&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;] &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; (flip (&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; liftA2 (&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;) id id) &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt;))) ((&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QQ wordpress why no Haskell highlighting &lt;ins&gt;(Editor’s note from 2017: The migration should highlight this now!)&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for some reason, you can do this in Haskell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;1&#34; href=&#34;#1&#34; data-line-number=&#34;1&#34;&gt;ghci&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceLine&#34; id=&#34;2&#34; href=&#34;#2&#34; data-line-number=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(via &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yellosoft.us/evilgenius/&#34;&gt;Haskell for the Evil Genius&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, but seriously now. I wrote this about my journey to learn functional programming in the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/programming&#34;&gt;programming babble post&lt;/a&gt; half a year ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The main obstacle I have is that it’s hard to optimize or get asymptotics when computation is expensive (a big problem if you’re trying to learn through Project Euler problems, particularly ones with lots of primes).

      <title>Adventures in Scala Pseudo-Abuse</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/scala</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2013 22:01:25 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/scala</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, what have I been doing with programming recently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scala-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing multiparadigm programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and interoperates with Java. I learned about it last time reading random articles on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say “amazing” I mean “This is a language in which my code gives me nerdgasms every time I read it.” Wheeee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, it’s not perfect. People say it’s too academic. It has a notoriously complicated type system (which is &lt;a href=&#34;http://scientopia.org/blogs/goodmath/2013/01/21/types-gone-wild-ski-at-compile-time/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turing-Complete&lt;/em&gt; at compile time&lt;/a&gt;). Its documentation is a bit patchy too. For a serious introduction, the Scala website has plenty of links under documentation, and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scala-lang.org/node/104&#34;&gt;tour of features&lt;/a&gt;. Somebody wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour&#34;&gt;another tour&lt;/a&gt; that explains things a bit more. So here, instead of introducing it seriously, I’m just going to screw with its features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example of freedom. Scala lets names consist of symbols, and treats one-parameter methods and infix operators exactly the same. The full tokenization rules are a bit detailed and I put them at the bottom of this post for the interested. This lets you create classes with arithmetic and domain-specific languages easily, but it also creates some silly opportunities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;scala&amp;gt; val * = 12
*: Int = 12

scala&amp;gt; * * * * *
res0: Int = 1728&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

      <title>Ridiculously Long-Winded Programming Babble</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/programming</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/programming</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay I don’t actually know how this pointless rambling got so long. I know the longer it is the more people will just tend to skim, because I do that all the time. So I went back and refactored—er, rewrote all the somewhat tangential bits (wow these puns are too easy) into footnotes. Manually. Obviously if I have to do this again I’ll write a script for it. But the post is still really long, and I bet nobody will read the whole thing. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life updates: I got out of the hospital Friday two-and-a-half weeks ago, went to the preliminaries of NPSC (a national team programming contest) with classmates, threw up a lot, went back into the hospital, and came out again. I wrote a lot of stuff about the experience and how much it sucked (hint: &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;) when I started this draft around that time, but now putting so much detail in this post feels weird. I’m mostly good now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years ago NPSC was the only programming contest I really knew of; now I’ve participated in quite a few more, both online and locally, but it’s still the only contest I’ve entered that gives you real-time verdicts. I believe it inherits this from being modeled after ACM-ICPC, but that’s for college people and I’m less clear on how it works. All the other contests, namely &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.topcoder.com/&#34;&gt;TopCoder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeforces.com/&#34;&gt;CodeForces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://usaco.org/&#34;&gt;USACO&lt;/a&gt;, and the other local individual competition (there doesn’t appear to be an English name so for the purpose of this post I’ll just call it “Nameless Local”; there’s a nation-wide competition in one-and-a-half weeks!), have system tests after the contest that don’t allow you to resubmit afterwards.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; They all give pretests that you get to know about right away, just to catch super-silly non-algorithmic mistakes like failing to remove the debug statements or reading input from the wrong place, but these contain weak test cases and don’t guarantee that the solution will pass the system tests and get full score.  After roughly parsing the rules on the IOI’s website, I believe the IOI (at least this year; I don’t know if it has evolved or anything) allows real-time testing and feedback with a confusing bunch of restrictions: how it apparently works is there are free “public tests”, and you can get results for a “release test” using the official test cases by using a “release token”, which you get two of every half hour. Additionally, there is apparently a cap of 64 submissions per problem, but I’m pretty sure it’s the kind of cap that honest competitors can safely ignore, like the 100-per-group in Australian puzzlehunts. Well, at least it tells us the organizers think in binary. Or octal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Okay, I give up. Here it is: Gridderface is a (quoting the project description, which I wrote anyway so whatever) “keyboard inferface for marking grid-based puzzles in Java” that I’ve been working on for too long. It is open-source under the GPL v3.
Basically, it’s a thing you can paste logic puzzle images into to solve them in, like people do in Paint, when you can’t or don’t want to print them.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay did I mention how I sucked at the command line? This is part of the journey towards stopping. Yes, I’m on a Mac and it’s not very *nix-y in some ways but it’s enough for me for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s story starts when I learned about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the pure-command-line GNU Debugger, which is incredibly cool. I have tried and failed to learn how to use the debug function on many of my IDEs; I found shotgunning &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; statements as needed faster. This may well be the first time I found a command-line tool so much more intuitive than the GUI-equipped programs. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: My 2012 self wrote this. It is preserved for historical interest and amusement, and does not reflect my current beliefs or attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laptop I’m typing this on is over two years old. This is not a lot by some measures, but weird spontaneous glitches are starting to accumulate to the point where they’re getting on my nerves. The internet card still needs an extra reset to start working half the time, and occasionally warrants a full reboot, which costs five minutes. The USB ports are loopy, some windows just show up black when they feel like it, and there’s a steadily climbing whir in the background. I’m kind of anticipating the moment the whole thing just drops dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m not about to run out of computers to use (there’s a noisy XP desktop that also barely works despite handling all our print jobs, but also one spanking new eight-core CPU laptop, which Dad considered a valuable enough investment (?)) but such a loss is still not something to be dismissed lightly. And the externalized cost is far more important and chilling. Who knows how many kids in the Congo had to mine coltan, or how much conflict has occurred over the crude oil, or what awful conditions those sweatshop-assembly workers are going through? Annie Leonard’s words still resonate with me from when we were first shown the video a year ago. Which is more recent than this laptop, so that doesn’t mean that much. I think a couple months ago I would have absolutely no second thoughts about getting a new one, though. Yup, I’m in a quandary (ha ha vocabulary) on the balance between desensitization and compulsive hoarding of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>There are two big elementary and middle school competitions around this part of the globe. Well, “big” according to “I’ve heard of it”, which is by no means an accurate measure of, well, anything. I don’t go out of my way to look for them any more, even though… hold on, am I still eligible? Whatever. But in any case, diverting any unnecessary energy from the olympiad-proof-training is probably not a good idea now.</description>

      <description>Installation Notes Personal list of Hackage packages to install, in approximate decreasing order of priority.
In Haskell Platform Changelog (in case there was any doubt)
GHC notably has array, bytestring, template-haskell, transformers.
Additional libraries notably include attoparsec, HTTP, HUnit, mtl, parsec, QuickCheck, text, vector.
Still, come to think of it, these libraries may well have updated since the platform release…
I’m too lazy to reinstall all of them, so here are the ones I recognize that I care about, minus containers because it mysteriously threatens to break ghc-7.</description>

      <description>(Ported from betaveros.stash. Wow, I get syntax highlighting and footnotes!)
A quick brief guide. At least, that’s how I planned it.
A lot of stuff is in the package java.awt.datatransfer. Class Toolkit is in java.awt.
Some basic classes. The class Clipboard is a clipboard, obviously. Its content is/will be an instance of the class Transferable. Some content can be read as different types of objects depending on what you want; to choose which type you use an instance of DataFlavor.</description>
