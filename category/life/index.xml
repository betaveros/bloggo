      <title>Olympiads: The Infinitely Overdue Retrospective</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I put this question in my FAQ, because at least two people have asked me this question, and that’s how frequent a question needs to be to be on my FAQ: I got an IMO&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gold medal in 2012, as a ninth grader, and an IOI gold medal in 2014, as an eleventh grader. I could have kept going to either, or even decided to try taking the IPhO or something, but I didn’t. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer: It was a rough utilitarian calculation. By continuing, I would probably displace somebody else who would gain more from being on an IMO/IOI team than I would. Besides, I wanted to do other things in high school, so I wasn’t losing much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the short answer actually captures most of my thinking when I made the decision back then, and it’s not really new; I said as much at &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/time&#34;&gt;the end of 2013&lt;/a&gt;. But behind it was a lot of complex thoughts and feelings that I’ve been ruminating over and trying to put into words for the better part of a decade. Hence, this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a natural question that precedes the frequently asked one that I have never been asked, something I am now realizing I never honestly asked myself and never tried to answer deeply: Why did I participate in the IMO and the IOI in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Prose and the Passion</title>

  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/y4sOfO8Ei1g&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pretty torn between this and “The Future Soon” as the Year-End Song on this blog, but in the end I think I feel more threatened by the bland existence of the soulless adult than inspired by the starry-eyed-idealism-with-misogynist-undertones of the twelve-year-old, plus I get to show you the best kinetic typography video I have ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway through 2018 I thought this would be the year of ephemeral phases. I felt like I went through a different phase every month — &lt;a href=&#34;https://dominion.games/&#34;&gt;Online Dominion&lt;/a&gt; in April, crosswords in June, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Connect&#34;&gt;Only Connect&lt;/a&gt; in July, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jonathancoulton.com/&#34;&gt;Jonathan Coulton&lt;/a&gt; in August, a brief stint of trying really hard to barre my guitar chords in October. Somewhere in the middle, I discovered Kittens Game (“the Dark Souls of Incremental Gaming”) and my summer internship mentor got me to pick up Pokémon Go again. A few intense periods of typographical study were interspersed, which involved watching the above music video dozens of times, teaching a Splash class on typography, and developing a new awareness of how &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenir_%28typeface%29&#34;&gt;Avenir&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;. During the last month, I went hard on &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/&#34;&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; and got second place, apparently the only person to make it on every single leaderboard. I also did a related &lt;a href=&#34;https://kara71.github.io/Advent-of-Golf-2018/&#34;&gt;golf side contest&lt;/a&gt; and poured a couple more hours into &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/betaveros/paradoc&#34;&gt;Paradoc&lt;/a&gt;, my personal golfing language, for rather unclear gain. At least I got a lot of GitHub followers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would turn out, though, that a lot of these phases had more staying power than I expected. Pokémon Go is a much better game than it was two years ago and has actually fostered a significant real-life community, which seems like one of the best possible outcomes of an augmented reality game, and I’ve found a steady pace to play at. I spread the Only Connect bug and people on my hall, intrigued by the format but annoyed by the overwhelmingly British trivia&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, started writing and hosting full games for each other, with our own MIT-slanted set of trivia. One of us developed a custom &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/krawthekrow/pi-connect&#34;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/krawthekrow/pi-connect-maker&#34;&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; to host these games. It took me a while to warm up to Jonathan Coulton’s latest album, but since it happened, I cannot get &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXuxwWm4huM&#34;&gt;Ordinary Man&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vig5byZx2Ew&#34;&gt;Sunshine&lt;/a&gt; out of my head; I’m still listening to JoCo as I finish typing up this post. Although I never got back to the peak of my crossword frenzy, I still study crosswordese from time to time and compose crosswords for some special occasions, like &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/christmas-somewhere.puz&#34;&gt;this one (.puz file)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The academics and technical aspects of this year have all blurred together, but I think my interests are finally crystallizing:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Transformation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think this is the right video for this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/lX44CAz-JhU&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the music and the animation. The music video spells out the central conceit somewhat explicitly, but I think the lyrics by themselves have a hint of ambiguity — is it a harmful addiction that you just can’t escape from, or an essential part of your identity that you just can’t deny?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What parts of me can I just not deny, huh? Unfortunately 2017 is also the year I decide my online presence should probably be a little more professional, so you might have to read between the lines a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me like lots of people want this year to be over. Among all the other things, 2016 is also apparently the year I totally abandon this blog and put off certain planned posts by several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this is what happens when you take five technical classes at MIT. The extracurriculars aren’t helping. And the fastest and most confident writing I do is still reactive, when there’s an externally-imposed deadline or when “somebody is wrong on the internet”. This blog isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, time to make up for it in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened this year? I’ll start with some serious categories:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is two days late and it’s not even the post that was supposed to be here. That will have to wait until I’m less hosed. &lt;a href=&#34;https://esp.mit.edu/&#34;&gt;ESP&lt;/a&gt; just finished running Splash, our largest annual event in which thousands of high school students come to MIT’s campus, and MIT community members (mostly) teach whatever they want to the students. This was the first big program I participated really deeply in as an ESP admin, and it has this way of eating you alive and spitting you out full of joy and immersion in life but devoid of energy and buffer zones for finishing other things by their deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, thanks for all the birthday wishes from everyone everywhere. I’m sorry I haven’t found the time to respond or sometimes reciprocate. This made my day, and probably last couple of weeks too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Time, Money, and All That Good Stuff: Part 1 of ∞</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/time-money-1</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had this 5,000-word draft, but I half-abandoned it for being sappy, boring, pointless, and impossible to rewrite to be satisfactorily un-cringeworthy. Instead, let me just tell you a couple random stories and anecdotes that went somewhere near the start. Maybe posting them will motivate me to salvage something from the 4,500 words that go after it and post it. Eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, Namecheap had a discount, so I bought a domain name for 88¢. Unfortunately, the discount only lasted for one year; afterwards, it would cost $29/year to renew. Even though I bought it on a whim and didn’t have much use for it, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect&#34;&gt;found myself wanting to keep it more and more&lt;/a&gt; and had a huge mental struggle over whether I could afford it, because wow, $29 is a lot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, during the same school year, more or less:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Conversations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most unexpectedly different facets of life during my internship has been the meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not talking about the food; it’s certainly different in a fantastic way (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/DropboxTuckShop/?fref=ts&#34;&gt;Dropbox’s food (link to Facebook page)&lt;/a&gt; is like something out of a high-end restaurant), but I knew that before coming already. Also of note is the way I started eating ∞% more ramen over the weekends than I did over the entire school year at MIT, because here I can’t buy that many groceries without them spoiling and am amazingly lazy in this new environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, this (deadlined, so not that well-thought-out, but whatever) post is about conversations at meals, which happen basically every lunch and some dinners when my team eats together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never had any regular experience like it. Of course I’ve had many meals at home with family, but they feel different because, well, it’s family and we have so many topics in common. I went to the same school for twelve years and we didn’t generally use a cafeteria; we just ate at our desks in our classrooms, or while doing things like attending club meetings or taking makeup tests. Sometimes if people felt like it they would push desks together to eat, but eating by oneself was totally normal. (At last, I feel like that was what it was. It seems so far away now that I don’t trust my memory, which is pretty sad… I faintly suspect I would have this experience in a more stereotypical American high school. But this is mostly just based off the cafeteria in &lt;cite&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/cite&gt;, a movie I only watched in its entirety on the flight here, which is weird because I know I’ve seen the “The limit does not exist!” part much much earlier. /aside)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at MIT? “Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am glad for these conversations over lunch because I get to know my team more personally (and don’t have to awkwardly eat alone in the bathroom), but they’ve also given me a lot of time to ponder my (lack of) conversation skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Zootopia</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/zootopia</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2016 14:27:21 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/zootopia</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(So. It’s spring break. Two-week-late post, and somehow by the end it’s all aboard the angst train again?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Sundays ago, I mobbed with a small group of MIT furries to watch &lt;cite&gt;Zootopia&lt;/cite&gt;, the recent highly-reputed Disney movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Before anything else, first there were the previews. I was impressed that every single one of them — there were six or so — was about an upcoming movie featuring anthropomorphic animals front and center. Let me see if I can remember all of them… in no particular order, &lt;cite&gt;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;The Secret Life of Pets&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;The Jungle Book&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Storks&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Finding Dory&lt;/cite&gt;, and &lt;cite&gt;Ice Age: Collision Course&lt;/cite&gt;. &lt;ins datetime=&#34;2016-04-09T05:10:42+00:00&#34;&gt;edit: Oh, also &lt;cite&gt;Angry Birds&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/ins&gt; Wow, I said, they know their audience.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went into the movie with a vague impression that &lt;cite&gt;Zootopia&lt;/cite&gt; was more adult-oriented than most Disney films — not in the naughty way, but in general making a lot of jokes and invoking a lot of parallels that I think only adults might have the experience to get. My suspicions were confirmed a few lines into the movie, where there was a joke about taxes I cracked up at but can’t imagine that children a few years younger would have found funny. If you the reader haven’t watched it, I hope that was vague enough not to ruin the start for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To be fair — and, uh, some parts of the internet are kind of big on this fact — the film also at one point enters a nudist colony. Fortunately (?), &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsLackAttributes&#34;&gt;Animals Lack Attributes&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humor aside, I think the movie also deals with some weighty and nuanced themes, ones that would take more life experience to fully appreciate than the themes of most Disney movies. The social commentary is very clear. Possibly bordering on too blatant for my tastes — even though the whole movie is kind of Funny Talking Animals, there are some animal species for which it’s really easy to guess which human demographic groups they might be symbolizing, to the point where I can already imagine the other side of the debate. You won’t need a PhD in literature to figure out the parallels; you wouldn’t even need an AP English Literature class. But, I think, it still works. It’s like &lt;cite&gt;Animal Farm&lt;/cite&gt; on training wheels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We’re overdue for one of these posts, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(all the crimes incomplete – listen, honestly I’ll live)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last-ditch feeble attempts at cleaning and reorganizing my desk and shelf before I figuratively drowned in academics led to me finding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
the Google physical linked puzzle, which I placed in the Kitchen Lounge to nerd-snipe people, successfully
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
a Burger King crown from the previous career fair
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
ID stickers from the Putnam, one of which is now on my keyboard cover cover (← not a typo), just because
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
assorted edibles, like candies and jellies, which I ate; as well as the half-finished Ziploc bag of candy from my FPOP, six months ago, which I just tossed in the trash
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
a box. It’s just, like, a box. I don’t know what goes or went into it
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel more in control of my living quarters. Marginally. Guess I’ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros and cons of having a departmental advisor in your area of interest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
Pro: the advisor knows something about the classes you want to take and can help you choose classes

Con: the advisor knows something about the classes you want to take and can help you choose classes

      <title>Ascension</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/ascension</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t sure what would be the right song for 2015 until I set foot on MIT. Then it was a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/KThlYHfIVa8&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do I even begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I thought cooking was hard. Then I ended up in the kitchen on the third floor of the west parallel of East Campus and had to produce something edible. So I figured out how to acquire chicken and put it in a pan with some onions and heat the whole thing up. It wasn’t even that bad! A few weeks later, I graduated to cooking in a rotation for six people. All this from a guy whose culinary abilities only went as far as frying eggs a few months ago. It’s incredible where life takes you sometimes.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I thought I couldn’t productively listen to lyrical music while doing homework, because I get distracted and/or bogged down by the feels. Turns out there’s a category of metal songs with great atmosphere and terrible lyrics that does the trick.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I had planned to suffer through introductory chemistry my freshman fall and introductory biology my freshman spring, and thereafter be done with required classes. Well, I took chemistry, but there was barely any suffering involved, and now biology fits nowhere on my freshman spring schedule.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some outlandish hopes I’d walk into college and be able to become mildly financially independent because people would throw high-paying jobs at me that I could learn from, but I didn’t expect it to happen. Life isn’t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; easy!&lt;/p&gt;
Well… it happened.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;incredible&lt;/em&gt; number of redacted things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been that kind of guy. Honest and innocent to a fault, no secrets except those arising from paranoid self-assigned concern about others’ privacy: that’s me. Until this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well, I can’t blog about it.&lt;/p&gt;
[redacted]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But mostly, of course, I actually graduated. The teacher-appreciation dinner happened (6/4), where I debuted my graduation song (woo!) and ate some good cake (double woo!); senior prom happened (6/7), with some awesome photos; and then, actually, the graduation ceremony. (6/10, same day I realized I had recently passed 100 starred things on GitHub.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;::looks at self:: I’m actually a college student now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every one of these stages of life seems like it should be a big deal, like I should pass through and suddenly know all the things about maturity and aspirations and life that are expected of college students, but it never happens that way.&lt;/p&gt;
At least, all things considered, I think this transition was very successful at taking my mind off the angsty side of things. This post is actually surprisingly unangsty. Sorry to disappoint if that’s what you’re here for!
&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are 30 minutes until my laundry finishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 2:30 in the morning as I write this. Normal people are not awake at this time of day. It’s possible that normal MIT students are, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been meaning to blog for a while, but things happen and other things happen and still more things happen. From a state of total inexperience in the kitchen, I’ve already managed to single-handedly cook six six-person meals for my co-op, not to mention all the weird meals I make for myself (which is just as well, I don’t think they are of typically mentionable caliber.) I’ve already taken two exams in three of my classes and the big midterm for my fourth. Four puzzlehunts — Simmons, aquarium, Palantir, ΣUMS; five if you perhaps include Next Haunt. Six SIPB meetings. A few bottles of Soylent; I lost count and don’t want to check my room because that’ll disturb my roommate. Θ(3000) zephyrs. And after many weekends of eye-opening group practice, tonight I have to catch a flight to Rochester, NY for ACM-ICPC regionals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did I say “fun”? That was short for function calls. Which are fun too, admittedly. Blah, I always go to such lengths to come up with snappy yet justified post titles and end up achieving neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more complimentary breakfast later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Code Jam World Finals. &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/nametag.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/nametag.jpg?w=170&#34; alt=&#34;[Google Code Jam 2015 name tag with my name and handle and country]&#34; width=&#34;170&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3374&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Let me take a moment to reflect. Seriously. I do not know how I made it this far this year. I guess I might be a top-500-ish competitive programmer globally, maybe even top-150-ish, but definitely not top-25-ish. And &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/4254486/dashboard#s=p3&#34;&gt;Log Set&lt;/a&gt;, the hard problem that got me through Round 3, doesn’t seem like it plays to my forte particularly either. It’s a bit mathy, but the math bits aren’t the hard part; I think it’s largely implementation, with one psychological hurdle where you have to realize that, because of how few distinct integers there are in S′, you can efficiently solve the subset-sum instances you need to produce the lexicographically earliest answer. I’m actually kind of impressed I got that. It seems like the sort of hurdle I usually get stuck on. How did this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe randomness. Maybe I was just particularly clear-minded during the round and wrote less buggy code than usual, because I had no expectation of making it whatsoever and so could look at the contest detachedly (until midway through the contest I accidentally noticed that my rank was under 20, and even then I tried very very hard not to think about it, and it kind of worked).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it happened, and now I’m here. Time to roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some emails much earlier in the Code Jam logistical process, Google had asked for “requests for changes and/or additions” to the software that would be installed on our competition computers, and I had sent them a long list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;br /&gt; Here are some things I’d like if they were installed, in decreasing order of priority:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The Vim plugin syntastic ( https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic )
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
a Haskell compiler (probably Haskell Platform 2014.2.0.0 https://www.haskell.org/platform/ even though it’s a year old)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
the Haskell package hdevtools ( https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hdevtools ) so that the above two may be integrated
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
(I don’t have enough Linux experience to name a specific thing to install, but command-line utilities that are the equivalent of pbcopy and pbpaste on Mac OS X, which allow me to redirect text into or out of the clipboard from the command line easily)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Of course, this is my first Code Jam and I don’t know how reasonable these requests are. Any nontrivial subset would be appreciated.

      <title>Orthogonal Planes</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/planes</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 11:13:14 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/planes</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a backlog of at least 6,000 words and still too many events to blog about, so these posts will not reflect things currently happening to me for a long, long time, except for the little blurbs on top of posts like this one when they exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I don’t have a good title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begins with an airplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/plane.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/plane.jpg?w=660&#34; alt=&#34;[View of airplane wing and clouds from airplane]&#34; width=&#34;660&#34; height=&#34;373&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3361&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Zarquon’s sake, you’re entrusting me with &lt;em&gt;my own passport and airline tickets and luggage and all this stuff I can’t even.&lt;/em&gt; I still layover people for months on end in &lt;cite&gt;Pocket Planes&lt;/cite&gt; sometimes. &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/cars&#34;&gt;(Watch the graceful descent of this reference into personally overused snowclone territory.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: Taiwan, my home for the previous twelve years, which I am now bidding farewell to for the longest time in forever (…which is only (“only”?) five months, assuming I fly back for winter break as already planned). Destination: Seattle, for this year’s Google Code Jam World Finals, which I still don’t know how I managed to qualify for (more on that in later posts); and, before that, an accompanying interview for an internship that I scored as part of the bargain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I successfully get on the plane, sort some nice things to have on hand into my MIT tote bag (how did I &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; survive airplanes without keeping a tote bag on hand?), and put my backpack with the rest of my stuff into the overhead compartment. An old-ish guy who is probably Korean sits next to me. Plane takeoff is a bit delayed due to traffic congestion. Once during the flight, after an attendant passes out forms to everybody entering South Korea and I tell him I’m not, the guy asks me where I’m going and we have a short conversation. But for the most part, it’s typical airplane shenanigans. I listen to Avril Lavigne and Ellie Goulding, do a little homework, and eat the airplane food. Nothing remarkable happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until near the end of the flight: a guy in a suit shows up in the aisle and, looking at some sort of checklist, calls my name.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Glowstick Fragments</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/fragments</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2015 09:34:22 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/fragments</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/glowstick&#34;&gt;Echoes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the HSR we kill time with weird games from Kevan Davis’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://kevan.org/fdgp/&#34;&gt;Freeze-Dried Games Pack&lt;/a&gt;, mostly Thirty-One. Then we’re there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bus we kill time with karaoke, until people complain. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch at Chinese restaurant. Beach resort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend the first one and a half hours holed up in my hotel room watching television, first a quiz show where the host asks foreigners living in Taiwan questions about the country’s culture and society, then Disney and Cartoon Network cartoons. During the commercial breaks I do cryptic crosswords I had brought along. This is something I self-deprecatingly talk about for the rest of the trip, but I have no regrets because the three cartoons I watch are literally my top three guilty pleasure cartoons, &lt;cite&gt;Ben 10&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Teen Titans Go!&lt;/cite&gt;, and &lt;cite&gt;Jake Long: American Dragon&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I wander around and join some guys playing pool. I do better than I expect, once pocketing three balls in sequential moves. There is also a Kinect with a dancing game, which I also score surprisingly well at and have lots of fun playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner, in which I eat 小卷 (“pencil squids”?) with way way way too much wasabi. I stuff myself and walk around chatting and eventually learn there are freshly-made 手卷 (“&lt;i&gt;temaki&lt;/i&gt;” / “hand roll”) downstairs. Since there’s lots of time I wait until I’m less full and eat two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group activity outside corresponds eerily to the one three years ago: shouting, dancing, waving glowsticks, arbitrary dance moves, punishment games, cooperation games, a competition where the guide gives out points that don’t matter like on &lt;cite&gt;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empty promises… but okay. Class songs. (This is the explicit version. This song is well above the normal offensiveness rating of this blog and I usually prefer official videos, instead of shady lyric videos probably made from Windows Movie Maker that might get taken down, but honestly I find the pathetic execution of censorship in the VEVO version more offensive.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ins date=&#34;2019-02-05T16:58:07-0500&#34;&gt;
edit from the future: There used to be an explicit YouTube video of Shots by LMFAO ft. Lil Jon here, which has since been taken down for obvious reasons. Yes, it is a very crude song. I never went to a party that was a tenth as wild as the song describes. Maybe it was my means of vicarious escape.
&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After it we have a sentimental moment listening to “See You Again”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At night our room flips through television and watches the second half of &lt;cite&gt;Iron Man 2&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[CIMC 2015 Part 3] Monsters and Pandas and Tigers, Oh My!</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/cimc-2015-part-3</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/cimc-2015-part-3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My inner perfectionist is crying that I have to post this, in particular over my pathetic &lt;a href=&#34;http://snowclones.org/2007/05/22/x-y-and-z-oh-my/&#34;&gt;snowclone&lt;/a&gt; title, but my inner pragmatist knows that, judging by my old blogging patterns, it’s now or never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18.06: 56%, haven’t touched it in a while, but I think I can do lots more on the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a non-contestant, I confess I feel totally uninvested in the results and find the Closing Ceremony boring. All contestants go up, country by country, and have their awards read off. No effort is made to make any sort of buildup to a climax. But maybe this is for the best; we don’t want anybody feeling shafted or discouraged from continuing to do math due to a mere elementary-/middle-school competition. Meanwhile, though, I’m browsing reddit on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this ceremony, the entire Taiwan delegation spends some time walking around outside while the guides make confused phone calls trying to decide where we eat lunch. My parents offer me some potato chips they bought somewhere, which are (as the label is really eager to point out) baked, not fried. Some time passes this way; eventually, the guides figure it out and we go through amazingly long queues to eat at the cafeteria, as usual. Then we are sent to a massive shopping mall for the afternoon, a place so large that its exits have number labels that go up into the double digits so that people don’t get lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take trippy failed panorama photos from the bus windows. &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/trippy-panorama.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/trippy-panorama.jpg?w=652&#34; alt=&#34;[trippy panorama of a shopping mall]&#34; width=&#34;652&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3321&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Nontopical life update: Current 18.06 homework status: 34% (mildly screwed, probably won’t finish before I leave my cozy home for the U.S. and I usually struggle to get into the mood for homework while traveling, but I guess I’ll have to)) &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/18-06-1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/18-06-1.png?w=296&#34; alt=&#34;[18.06 status panel: 34%]&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (I’ve been spending most of my uptime doing said homework and running errands, and my downtime catching up on &lt;cite&gt;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&lt;/cite&gt; while farming the Flight Rising Coliseum. And, okay, making the above status panel. &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5295912/status.html&#34;&gt;Live version here&lt;/a&gt; courtesy of Dropbox’s Public folder.

&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-3-excursions&#34;&gt;
Day 3 (Excursions)
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morning routine snipped. We come to the middle school again to eat breakfast and gather; the contestants will be taking their tests here (accompanied by one bottle of “Buff” energy drink each) while the rest of us will be going on an excursion. Before this happens, though, two Taiwanese contestants ask me and Hsin-Po some math problems. There’s a geometry problem, which I fail to solve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(paraphrased) In triangle △ABC, ∠A is 40° and ∠B is 60°. The angle bisector of ∠A meets BC at D; E is on AB such that ∠ADE is 30°. Find ∠DEC.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hsin-Po figures out that, once you guess (ROT13) gur bgure boivbhf privna vf nyfb na natyr ovfrpgbe naq gurl vagrefrpg ng gur vapragre, lbh pna cebir vg ol pbafgehpgvat gur vapragre naq fubjvat sebz gur tvira natyr gung gurl vaqrrq pbvapvqr.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Then, there’s a combinatorics problem in a book with a solution that they’re not sure about:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[CIMC 2015 Part 1] Rainy Days in July (and Other Months)</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/cimc-2015-part-1</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 13:48:45 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/cimc-2015-part-1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We get up at 3:40 AM. By 4 AM we have left our house, speeding like a bullet into the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Ohai. Somehow it slipped my mind that I was ending my streak by leaving the country for a competition that would likely be highly bloggable, like my last two international olympiads, both of which led to notable post sequences on this blog. (Admittedly, the first one was never really completed…) My only excuse was that I was worried I might not be able to access my blog from inside the Great Firewall, but I did (via vpn.mit.edu) and even if I hadn’t, I could still have drafted posts locally in Markdown as I usually do, so I don’t know what I was thinking.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Also: because, as I’ve said way too many times recently, I need to do linear algebra homework, these posts aren’t going to be as complete or as perfect as I’d like them to be. Although I’m probably just saying this to persuade myself; I tend to include many of the boring parts as well as the interesting parts of the trip, which maybe benefits my future self at the expense of other readers. I probably need to get out of this habit more if I want to blog for a wider audience, though. Oh well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;backstory&#34;&gt;
Backstory
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imc-official.org/&#34;&gt;International Mathematics Competition&lt;/a&gt; (IMC) is, &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin&#34;&gt;as it says&lt;/a&gt;, an international mathematics competition. But I should add that it is for elementary and middle-school students (in other words, I am not competing, okay??). (edit: Also, one or two letters are often prefixed to indicate the host country, for whatever reason. This year it would be CIMC, C for China.) I am tagging along because I am a student of Dr. Sun, one of the chief organizers, and have been slotted to give a talk and possibly help with grading the papers and translating. My father is coming to help arrange a side event, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://dominosolver.com/&#34;&gt;domino puzzle game&lt;/a&gt; competition, which he programmed the system for; and my mom and sister are also coming to help with translation and other duties. Other people in our group: Dr. Sun himself, his longtime assistant slash fellow teacher Mr. Li (wow I’m sorry I forgot you while first writing this), my friend and fellow math student Hsin-Po, who is an expert at making polyhedra from origami or binder clips (and at Deemo); Chin-Ling, my father’s student/employee who also programmed lots of the domino puzzle server and possesses a professional camera; and, of course, all the elementary- and middle-school contestants, as well as most of their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’ve ever given this amount of background exposition about any event I’ve attended to my not-so-imaginary audience before. It feels weird. Some part of me is worried about breaking these people’s privacy by posting this, which makes a little bit of sense but not enough for me to think that it’s actually a valid reason to avoid or procrastinate blogging. I think it’s a rationalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;
Day 1
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only interesting thing that happens at the airport is a short loud argument in the queues for luggage check-in, perhaps partly fueled by our high number of people and of heavy boxes (gifts for other countries and raw materials for Hsin-Po’s polyhedra). I don’t know whose fault it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case I fail to scale the firewall, I attempt to download Facebook on my phone for one last look before boarding, but it fails during installation twice and I give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plane is not fancy enough to offer personal screens and entertainment centers for everybody, but thankfully the ride lasts only three hours, so this is tolerable. Instead, the plane plays the second &lt;cite&gt;Divergence&lt;/cite&gt; movie on overhead screens, which I watch half-heartedly. The plot setup seems interesting but the ending seems to me to involve two Ass Pulls™, although since I haven’t been paying much attention I am not confident if I just missed some foreshadowing or character development. On the flight, I also read the proof of the irrationality of powers of &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;cite&gt;Proofs from THE BOOK&lt;/cite&gt; and leaf through the magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t hear any good music on-board, except maybe “Space Oddity”, which is a little freaky to be listening to while cruising at so may kilometers in the sky. Perhaps because of this, I find myself singing and humming “Space Oddity” unexpectedly often over the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;arrival&#34;&gt;
Arrival
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first sign we see after alighting the plane consists entirely of characters that are the same in Simplified and Traditional Chinese — if I remember correctly, 「前有坡道，小心慢走」&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Changchun airport looks like any other airport, coolly blue-themed with moving platforms. The restrooms have fancy bright purple soap. Even though I consciously think about how I have suddenly arrived in a country that places notable restrictions on freedom of speech and Internet access, I don’t feel it. Eep, what an anticlimax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/gravel.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/gravel.jpg?w=652&#34; alt=&#34;[People dragging luggage boxes over gravelly ground outdoors.]&#34; width=&#34;652&#34; height=&#34;369&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3267&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Translation Party</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/translation-party</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2015 23:53:12 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/translation-party</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a short anecdote for the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;streak&lt;/a&gt; today. Hmm, I guess this developed beyond being just another filler post, which is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to preparing my presentation, the other job I have to do for the math competition I’m attending in a week or so (not as a participant, okay?) is translating various guests’ speeches between English and Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speeches’ length and formulaicness really get on my nerves, but then again my standards for speeches were skewed upward by Richard Forster’s speeches during the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/lightsabers&#34;&gt;opening&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/xanthous&#34;&gt;closing&lt;/a&gt; ceremony of IOI 2014, but on the gripping hand I don’t think it’s that hard to at least &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; not to be formulaic and I really can’t see any effort on their part whatsoever. Off the top of my head, pretty much all the speeches tend to go like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Welcome!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Math is great!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
This competition is great!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The city hosting this competition is great!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The college hosting this competition is great!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
You contestants are great!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Good luck!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except each bullet point is a paragraph that lasts a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Ninja edit: Which is not to say they didn’t put any effort into their speeches at all, but that much of the effort seem misguided to me. I don’t see how anybody who has been in the audience for one of these speeches can overlook the same flaws in their own. Unless it’s like, at some point in the natural life cycle of the human brain, people spontaneously start enjoying these safe and repetitive speech topics instead of some earnest and maybe lighthearted advice and anecdotes and jokes? Like how people somehow start enjoying spicy stuff, or the bitter flavor of beer and wine, or writing teenage-angsty ranty posts complaining to nobody in particular like this one? Tough questions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. My mom actually does most of the translation but I am the grammar stickler post-processor and we work together on the hard parts. The second hardest things to translate are idioms. The hardest things to translate are quotes. It turns out that lots of people find translated quotes to Chinese and it can be incredibly difficult to reconstruct their English versions. Here is the quote that today’s story is about, which we were tasked with providing the English translation (or original) for and which the speech attributed to 克莱因 (trad.: 克萊因).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr: anybody want to add me on Line or tell/remind me about other phone chat apps? betaveros as always.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, talk about uninspired post titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a new phone today. Or, well, it’s second-hand, actually. I try to make electronics last a long time, but I think this was justified given the state of my last phone’s screen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, I’m going off to college and all. Anyway, the phone is pretty cool. It’s a slick shade of red, it came with a cover and everything, and it has one of those fancy 3x3-grid locks. How secure are those again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we could just &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6979524/android-lock-password-combinations&#34;&gt;find the answer on StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s boring.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ll probably be making filler posts for a while until I make decent progress on linear algebra and programming work, including another presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s listen to some more music.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Last Step</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/last-step</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is more than slightly intimidating to go into the room through the big sliding door and see everybody dressed up in full-on green surgical garb with masks and hair nets. I don’t remember this part. Feeling a little vulnerable, I change my clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask to listen to my iPod during the operation — I remember being able to do this during the operation four long years ago when the subject of today’s surgery was inserted into my shoulder — but the nurse(?) says it’s best not to do that because they’ll be using something electric to stop the blood. Instead I can listen to music played from a computer in the operating room. Well, okay then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She escorts me through a bunch of twisty little passages to said room. The computer is a dual-screen Windows XP. The nurse shows me that there is a folder with random albums sorted by year. I poke through the folders and create a playlist in Windows Media Player interleaving &lt;cite&gt;1989&lt;/cite&gt; with a collection of classics from 五月天(Mayday). Then I get on the operating table and wait. One of the nurses compliments me on my choice of the latter band. A few tracks later, I deduce that my interleaving had been to no avail because the media player was set to shuffle. I spend a lot of time on the operating table at first not doing anything except stare at the ceiling. There is a white three-legged contraption there, with each hinged limb ending in a large blue-rimmed circle of surgical lights. There are white sans-serif letters inscribed on the rims, saying Chromophare® E 668 and Berch-something. I think the “something” was a synonym for “say” or “tell”. An after-the-fact search says it’s Berchtold. Typical human memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I am covered with lots of green cloth, which blocks out the ceiling. Instead, I can only see a clipboard and random paper forms on the left side of my peripheral vision, presumably propping up the cloth. The clipboard is a highly translucent pink. The form on top is yellow and has a box saying something about somebody paying; the form on bottom is white with a black-and-pink-striped right border. The clipboard’s clip also has random streaks of black marker across a white sticker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music plays.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scary Cars</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/cars</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Part of a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak&lt;/a&gt; but for once I don’t think I need to apply the disclaimers to this. If you thought for even one second that the title was a palindrome, I’ve succeeded. It’s not. I don’t have a good title. Okay, maybe slap the disclaimers onto that part.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I drove a car was on 5/18. I think. I might be off by a day or so. Most of that day’s lesson was spent learning to go forward and backward, accelerate and decelerate smoothly, and turn the wheel without getting my hands tangled up. My coach made me count out loud how many circles I was turning: 一圈半圈半圈一圈etc. It felt kind of stupid when I was doing it, but I guess in the end it helped, and eventually once I got the hang of turning the wheel, I just subvocalized it and my coach also tacitly stopped bothering me about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I activated a turn signal light was probably on 5/26. That was the day I wrote in my TIL log that, when you turn the steering wheel back from the direction you were turning, the turn signal lights turn off automatically. After you think about it, this is a pretty sensible thing for turn signal lights to do, but when I first learned this my mind was utterly blown. Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like when you’re turning and you turn on the turn signal and it starts clicking this steady beat to increase the dramatic tension, like you’re doing a trick in a sports driving game and you have to quickly hit the right sequence of buttons on the controller. Then you actually turn the corner and then turn the wheel back, and as the wheel makes its smooth sliding sound back to its upright position, the beat stops like a resounding V7 to I resolution, as if to congratulate you on executing a beautiful turn without crashing into another car or driving off the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what it feels like, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On slow days, when you’re halfway through a turn but the drivers ahead of you are waiting in a queue that stretches on forever on the practice track, you can shift to the parking gear and use the turn signal’s beat as a metronome and sing along to it too. I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, of course, there’s the obligatory xkcd:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>8 Songs for 18 Years</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/8-songs</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2015 13:40:30 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/8-songs</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At some point I thought, hmm, maybe this blog would benefit from some more sentimental, memory-capturing music/videos, like I chose for my &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/time&#34;&gt;end of 2013 post&lt;/a&gt; or my &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/rewind&#34;&gt;end of 2014 post&lt;/a&gt;. (Yeah, I link to my own posts alarmingly often. I think that’s kind of weird. I don’t know.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, because you’re reading this already, I decided to follow through with that idea. There’s no particular significance for posting this now — it’s not my birthday or anything, as the title might suggest; it just has a nice ring to it — except of course that I’m starting to get mildly desperate for content for my &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak exercise&lt;/a&gt;. Standard disclaimers apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mostly for my future self. I should note that, although I like these songs, this is not a list of my absolute most favorite songs ever. You can tell because there isn’t any Coldplay or fun. (the band.) Instead, each of these songs was chosen to be meaningful to myself and my life in at least two different ways that generally don’t overlap with the other songs. This was difficult but I think I managed it — you know, how constraint breeds creativity and everything? Also, they’re arranged by approximate chronological order of impact. But it also means that this list isn’t going to be that meaningful to anybody other than myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I have a long list of class-of-2015 sentimental songs, which I’m not including here because I think there are so many that they deserve a separate post. Will I avoid procrastinating and feeling awkward for long enough to make such a post? Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;shrugs&lt;/em&gt; Whatever, enjoy the music or stop reading now if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1: Simon &amp;amp; Garfunkel - Scarborough Fair/Canticle&lt;/strong&gt;

      <title>Spontaneous Thoughts on Teaching</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/thoughts-teaching</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Jun 2015 23:04:09 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/thoughts-teaching</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Disorganized and probably incomplete blog content, posted as part of a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak I have openly committed to&lt;/a&gt;; standard disclaimers apply)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I’m actually going to try starting this blog post and posting it in the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story: As a sort of extracurricular activity slash side job, I taught a math class after school once a week to six fifth-graders. It was nominally geared towards some Australian Math Competitions, which my math teacher administers in Taiwan, although in the end I don’t think I achieved this end very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After writing this brain dump I realized this was a pretty terrible hackjob; I had absolutely no idea how to teach fifth-graders or how to organize an after-school class, and I still mostly don’t. Parents did most of the organizing, really. And provided refreshments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I get paid for this????&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulleted list of other thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, I didn’t realize / remember how serious the gender gap between elementary-school students is. I don’t mean the difference between their performance (that might have been the case, but I don’t think I felt a significant enough difference to conclude anything); I mean how fifth-grade boys and fifth-grade girls don’t like to mingle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When given the opportunity, they would pick team names like, “[members of my gender] Rule, [members of other gender] Drool!” They wouldn’t discuss with each other either. If prompted, they would sometimes point out mistakes in each others’ work, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a phase that people grow out of, and I probably did it myself when I was young. I don’t remember when it ends, but in any case, ugh, it’s so unproductive that boys and girls separate themselves for any length of time at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Obligatory life update: I have graduated &lt;a href=&#34;https://motivatedgrammar.wordpress.com/2012/01/24/a-brief-history-of-speaking-about-graduation/&#34;&gt;[from]&lt;/a&gt; high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not what this post is about. I &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/scheduled-blogging&#34;&gt;contemplated setting up a schedule for my blogging&lt;/a&gt; three long years ago, and decided against it, because I didn’t think writing was a high enough priority for me. Well, I am setting up a schedule now: &lt;strong&gt;I am going to post something on this blog every day&lt;/strong&gt; until I have to leave the country (which is happening once before college, so it’s not for as long as you think; but I might decide to continue the schedule anyway after I get back. We’ll see when the time comes.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Three Standard Deviations</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A PSYCHOLOGICAL TIP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you’re called on to make up your mind,&lt;br /&gt; and you’re hampered by not having any,&lt;br /&gt; the best way to solve the dilemma, you’ll find,&lt;br /&gt; is simply by spinning a penny.&lt;br /&gt; No — not so that chance shall decide the affair&lt;br /&gt; while you’re passively standing there moping;&lt;br /&gt; but the moment the penny is up in the air,&lt;br /&gt; you suddenly know what you’re hoping.&lt;/p&gt;
— Piet Hein
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;By the way&lt;/em&gt;, apparently spinning a penny is a terrible randomization process; studies have shown they &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/gamblers-take-note-the-odds-in-a-coin-flip-arent-quite-5050-145465423/&#34;&gt;come up tails &lt;strong&gt;80%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time.&lt;/a&gt; Tossing or flipping is better but there’s still a faintly biased &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/diaconis_coinbias.pdf&#34;&gt;51% chance it lands with the same face it started with (PDF link)&lt;/a&gt;. Entirely irrelevantly, is the meter amphibrachic? Nice. I’m sorry, but the impenetrable English names they give to metrical feet just sound so cool.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As May 1 has been coming up, I’ve been half-seriously giving this advice to others who still haven’t decided. But I knew this wouldn’t work for me. I knew where I intuitively wanted to go all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons holding me back were more… reasonable. Mostly the money. Call it an id-superego conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if the difference between my choices would mean I’d have to take out loans, or work a lot during college, or both. I don’t think either of those things would be difficult. I think tech internships over the summer could just cover the parts assigned to parental contribution (which I’m not going to let my parents pay, unless they start earning &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; more money than expected) and I think I have the skills to get those internships. But of course that’s a tradeoff. Maybe there will be something more self-actualizing or more helpful to my future career that I could do during the summer. I’m not so sure that I’ll find the same drive to program for a job instead of for a personal project I really want to use myself, or for putting off something more boring. I don’t know yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Get it? Drive? Program? Um, never mind, I guess that’s a hardware problem.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Okay. So. These things:

These things are a thing. They’re like mini-trampolines that you are supposed to strap onto your feet and jump around on to have fun, if you’re, like, six years old, maybe?
Anyway, if you happen to run into a pair of these, please be careful, and please think twice before doing something like, I don’t know, immediately strapping them on after you see them and jumping as hard as you possibly can, especially not when you are jumping on a hard unforgiving surface, or when you are surrounded by a bunch of impressionable children whom you could be concerned might follow your example or be swayed by your bad influence or something.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As per &lt;a href=&#34;http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/50_things&#34;&gt;item 3 of 50&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infinitelooper.com/?v=zAC_teyfrHU&#34;&gt;InfiniteLooper version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there are better memory-triggering songs but I think this pretty much sums up how I feel about blogging right now (possibly including the very act of choosing that song.) And college apps. And life. Plus, the music video is silly in its own incredible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Around this time a year ago, I made &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/time&#34;&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; talking about how around a year before that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I paused my participation in big high-school competitions, for a variety of reasons.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I rambled on life and programming competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t get it yet, this post so far has been written to meaningfully echo the last one. Nothing so abrupt has happened this year, but I just realized how nice it was to have a paragraph humorously listing the weird stuff I had gotten myself into over the course of 2013, so I’m going to do so again, even more completely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>College Questions (unprotected ver.)</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/college-qs</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/college-qs</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post, or most of it, was published password-protected once because… well, I explain that below. (To the one person who actually bothered asking me for the password, just so you know, I did add and rewrite parts. More than a few.) I forgot how distinctly powerful a disincentive a large 2300-word block of text is to the average person, especially when the subject of half of those 2300 words is teenage angst (I’ve already linked to &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/1370/&#34;&gt;xkcd 1370&lt;/a&gt; in enough places so I’m not even going to embed it here) interweaved with an insufferable amount of rationalist jargon. This will probably filter my readership more than sufficiently already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have still decided to protect one detail of the thought process, though. But even after that, I guess I do care more about how many people read this than I do for most of my other posts, so here’s a primitive attempt to gauge interest; if you choose anything beyond the first choice, I would also appreciate if you leave a comment, even if you don’t think you have anything to add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ins datetime=&#34;2017-11-24T18:33:34-0500&#34;&gt;
edit: This poll has been removed, it wasn’t very interesting anyway.
&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t posted for a long period again, but I don’t feel too bad about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, until I look carefully at my blog draft folder and remember that I have 90%-finished drafts about the two debate competitions I went to (November 2013 and March 2014), and winning the previous Mystery Hunt (January 2014), and my summer trip to Penghu (July 2013). Which will probably never get posted out of awkwardness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’ve been busy, completely righteously busy, with college apps to write and algorithm classes to teach and speeches to write and a math club to sort-of lead and all the typical homework besides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then (for those of you who don’t have me as a friend on Facebook) I got accepted to MIT and Caltech early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for a few days after that, I checked Facebook about sixteen times a day for the Class of 2019 group discussion, except for one day when I really needed not to, thanks to the power of committing to my HabitRPG party to do something. I am increasingly learning that procrastination is something that has to be actively and strategically fought. But that’s not what this post is about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Miscellaneous observations that didn’t make it into a compelling narrative, sometimes because I have forgotten exactly when they happened, sometimes because I only remembered when they happened after blogging about it, sometimes because it just seemed too tangential, sometimes just because of the circumference of the mooooooooooooooooon! (That made no sense and I’m not going to remember what I’m alluding to in a few months.)   During the first day a guy came into the secret computer room that the Taiwan team had concealed themselves in, saw us watching anime (SAO 2 among others), and innocently asked, “Are you the Japanese team?</description>

      <title>[IOI 2014 Part 4] Shades of Xanthous</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No, I didn’t forget. Not for one minute. I was doing homework. I am very happy because that means I was actually carrying out my priorities as I envisioned them. I’ve probably edited this post too many times, though. Meh. But it’s the first weekend after finishing summer homework, so here we go again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: This is by far my favorite post title in the entire series. Possibly in the entire history of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning of the last day of official IOI activities, there were a bunch of cultural activities, e.g. writing Chinese characters calligraphically, doing tricks with the diabolo, or picking up beans with chopsticks, and noncultural activities, e.g. getting somebody to pour water into a cup on your head while he or she was blindfolded. Due to the last activity I got wet, but my shirt dried really quickly. And alas, even though I had taken calligraphy summer classes a long time ago, my calligraphy was awful — robotic, lifeless strokes without the right aesthetic proportions to make up for it. Blargh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, lunch followed, and then it was time for the closing ceremony, in the same building as the other ceremonies and contests. Our team caught the ending song of in a Chinese musical being rehearsed as we walked into the auditorium. While we waited for everybody, we milled about waving flags that our various teachers had brought, including not only Taiwan’s flag but also flags of my school, thoughtfully brought by teachers who had volunteered. A little later our leader told us that all the leaders had discussed the matter during a meeting and decided that we shouldn’t bring any flags to the stage while receiving our medals, so we were going to have to make do with being patriotic and school-respecting off stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few performances, including two aboriginal music performances and the musical we had seen rehearsed ealier, which was a fun rock musical rendition of some Chinese tale that seemed to have been sharply abridged, giving it the plot depth of a Wikipedia stub-article synopsis — a conflict, boy-meets-girl-and-falls-in-love, and a lamenting Aesop song conclusion with thrillingly vague general applicability. But the singing and counterpointing and atmosphere were good. I guess it was proportional to the relative importance of the performance to the closing ceremony. The program interleaved them with the long-awaited medal presentations: one round of bronze medalists, one round of silver, one round of gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dum-dum-dum-dum, medals! The home team advantage was really obvious here; the cheering and the medal-presenter handshakes were both significantly more forceful for Taiwan’s medalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/gold.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/gold.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;I think our leader made this. Thanks.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
I think our leader made this. Thanks.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, after the normal medals had been exhausted, the three full scorers received bags with prizes that may forever remain unknown to my sorry self, as well as a standing ovation from everybody in the auditorium. The orchestra had been going through ABBA songs during the ceremony, and very considerately played “The Winner Takes It All” for this part. It was impossible not to mentally fill in the lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The winner takes it all&lt;br /&gt;The loser has to fall&lt;br /&gt;It’s simple and it’s plain&lt;br /&gt;Why should I complaiiiiiiiin?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speeches followed. Most were just average forgettable speeches, but Forster gave another speech that was somehow even better than the one he gave at the opening ceremony, with nonstop golden quotables such as:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[IOI 2014 Part 3] Games of Luck and Strategy and Really Weird Noises</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/games</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shamelessly getting unfinished business out of the way. Yup, that’s me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excursion Day 1. We traveled down to Yilan on a bus. I played guess-it with Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
I was quite surprised at myself for remembering this game, but I think it’s simple and little-known enough to be worth mentioning. Guess-it is a remarkably pure game of luck and bluffing from one of Martin Gardner’s columns, played with a small odd number of cards, e.g. the 13 cards of one poker suit. The cards are dealt evenly to players (who can look at them) with one card left over, which is kept face down; players take turns choosing one of two actions:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Name a card and ask the other player if he or she has it. These questions must be answered honestly.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Guess the left-over card. The guesser wins if correct; the other player wins if not.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess-it is not trivial because sometimes you should ask the other player if he or she has a card that you already see in your hand; otherwise whenever you answered “no” to a query you’d immediately guess that the asked card is the hidden one. It is actually a solved game in the sense that the probabilities of the Nash equilibrium strategy for when to guess and when to bluff have been worked out already, but they’re not simple probabilities by any means and humans are terrible randomizers anyway. A few rounds of it sure beats rock-paper-scissors. I was very amused to lose almost all our games with 11 cards but win almost all of our games with 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, no more gratuitous narrative excursions into game-theory. The first stop, National Center for Traditional Arts, was a very laid-back culture place with old-fashioned retro shops and streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We watched a 3D glove puppetry (布袋戲) video, in the same session as a lot of the leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>[IOI 2014 Part 1] Everything is More Exciting with Lightsabers</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/lightsabers</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2014 17:31:10 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/lightsabers</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, I guess it was really naïve of me to suppose that I could get any considerable amount of blogging done before the IOI ended. Onward…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left off at the end of the practice session. As if somebody were taking revenge against us for not having to suffer through any airplane trips, we were served a cold airplane meal for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, the box had a sticker that noted its manufacturer as something something Air Kitchen and another translucent sticker that badly covered an inscription saying the same thing in much bigger letters. It contained a cold apple salad, a cold chicken bun, a cold flat plastic cylinder of orange juice, and a package of plastic utensils that was exactly like the utensils that came with every airplane meal ever. I was disappointed, but at least the salad tasted okay, and I ate an extra one because two of my teammates volunteered theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pass the time, we played an extra-evil &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-nine_(addition_card_game)&#34;&gt;ninety-nine&lt;/a&gt; variant. Apparently this is a very Taiwanese game because lots of student guides were teaching their teams the game, although our special cards differ from the ones Wikipedia lists in a lot of ways and our evil variant created more opportunity for sabotage and counter-sabotage and bluffing. 7s are used to draw your replacement card from somebody else’s hand, and that person cannot draw again and will have one less card; aces are used to swap your entire hand with somebody else, who also cannot draw a card; small-value cards can be combined to form special values (e.g. play a 2 and 5 for the effect of a 7) but after playing a combination you can only draw one replacement card; and later, to speed up the game, we added a rule where all 9s had to be unconditionally discarded without replacement but would still get shuffled back into the draw pile. Players lose if it’s their turn and they have no playable cards, including no cards at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were playing and repeatedly reveling in everybody ganging up to beat the winner from the last round, an instrumental version of “You Are My Sunshine” played on repeat in the background for literally the entire time. It wasn’t a very good version either. If you didn’t listen carefully for the fade-out and few seconds of silence at the end of each loop, you’d think that the loop was only one verse long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Late post. As usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with an online competition — write programs, solve problems, get points. I wouldn’t call the problems easy, but they weren’t hard either. So I solved all of them. To make it even less impressive, only about twenty people submitted anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the result was just what it was: I ended up with a free ticket to &lt;a href=&#34;https://tw.pycon.org/2014apac/en/&#34;&gt;PyCon APAC 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d prefer a conference about a more functional programming language, but I’ll take what I get. Another adventure!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rise from the Ashes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the first stage of selection camp, I was very nervous because I was fifth place in a selection sequence that would finally result in a team of four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I screwed myself over on the first mock test by committing to a bad implementation method on a problem that was hard to get points on. My method seemed simple, but the memory usage leaked out in a way that was confusing and hard to patch; unfortunately, I tried to patch it in increasingly desperate and convoluted ways rather than scrapping the method, and thus missed out on many of the points elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the second test I failed to read the last problem carefully and spent too much of my time on the second problem, once again missing out on a lot of relatively easy points. I had optimized and optimized and pushed my quadratic runtime down to linearithmic, which would allow me to get the points for the last subtask — or so I thought. But with 10 minutes left I had all but one testcase right, and after desperately rereading my code, I realized that I had a string comparison stuck in an inner loop that could make my runtime degenerate to quadratic if the input string had lots of the same digit. In order to have a solidly linearithmic algorithm, I would have to implement a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_array&#34;&gt;suffix array&lt;/a&gt;. Ten minutes? I gave up. (The problem setters told me afterwards that hashing would have worked too; I didn’t think of that at all. Oops.) I spent the 10 minutes reading the last problem and still failed to read it carefully. So that did not go very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as the title probably gave away, during the third and fourth mock tests everything went much better than expected. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(Ironically, I discovered it on /r/InternetIsBeautiful.)
These claims sound a bit hyperbolic, but they are actually working on me. Most notably: for the three days after I discovered it, most of which has been spent at IOI selection camp away from school and worldly concerns, I’ve only gone on reddit once — and only for about two minutes.</description>

      <title>The Sands of Time</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/time</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Random video! Although I feel that I’ve heard it earlier, my first conscious memory of getting linked to it is from &lt;a href=&#34;http://usamoarchive.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/youre-older-than-youve-ever-been/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. At first I thought it would be the right background music for this post, but upon further reflection I think it mainly suited me while I was writing this post. Well, it’s topical if you mentally replace “day” with “year”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/q2bo_u_YmW8&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Around this time a year ago, I paused my participation in big high-school competitions, for a variety of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I stopped attempting to make IMO both because I wouldn’t get that much from the training and because other people ought to have the opportunity. I was concerned that I might condition myself to only be able to do math with the short-term motivation of contests. Better to focus on college math and maybe some original research, I thought. During the year, I did lots of the former and very little of the latter. Meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the IOI, my obvious next target: I was tired of training and going abroad while paranoid about whether my immune system would hold up. I didn’t feel that the IOI was worth that. To some degree, I also felt burned out about programming. Long story short, my treatment should end soon, and learning Haskell completely resolved the burnout problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most important reason, I think, was that “high school was too short”. I started math competitions ridiculously early and didn’t spend much time exploring other interests. I thought I knew myself well enough that I could say I didn’t have many more interests at all, but I was completely wrong (psych nerds will reflexively note this to be the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect&#34;&gt;Dunning-Kruger effect&lt;/a&gt;). I coded lots in weird languages — Haskell, as mentioned previously, plus Scala, plus all manner of other magical command line tools. I wrote my first math problem and submitted it officially, picked up a new instrument, went to a debate competition, served as an unimportant tech guy for MUN, discovered and became hooked on Pentatonix, participated in three puzzle hunts in Australia and one in Massachusetts, figured out my rough political stance, rode a boat, got retweeted by &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34; data-cites=&#34;eevee&#34;&gt;@eevee&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34; data-cites=&#34;Kyrgyzstan_News&#34;&gt;@Kyrgyzstan_News&lt;/span&gt;, increased my Neopets™ fortune by over 3400%, and lurked on FurAffinity a little too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, dear competition world, I’m back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t remember how long it had been since we entered the ninth floor. Somebody had covered the elevator area with cartoon animals and landscapes. Not surprising, since all the children’s wards were here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny idea, that: I am still a child for medical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not sick. Not more than usually, anyway. I didn’t need to get an IV drip installed or even change into the patient uniform the first night. There was nothing to do or feel. No guilt or fear, unlike last time — this check-up had been scheduled for along time and served as a simple test to see how my bone marrow was doing. No annoyance, either, because I knew it mattered; but no apprehension of the results, or of the needles. You can never get used to the needles, but you learn to just accept them anyway. There is nothing to be done about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows? The result could be something bad. But I know enough not to take this hypothetical seriously before it was anything other than hypothetical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slept, and dreamt of vomiting carrots.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it weird to suddenly talk about this topic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think that I have ever talked about music any more than briefly in passing. It might be confusing to my &lt;em&gt;finger quotes&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;audience&lt;/em&gt;, and I worry I’ll seem inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. If you wonder, “I didn’t know that you sang and played the piano, or you liked music in that way — or, at all…” please note that I didn’t know either.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So, I somehow managed to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~mums/puzzlehunt/teamstats.html?team=not+AoPS&#34;&gt;get 25 points all by myself&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~mums/puzzlehunt/&#34;&gt;MUMS Puzzle Hunt 2013&lt;/a&gt;. Well, I pestered chaotic_iak a little with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~mums/puzzlehunt/2013/puzzles/3.3_Diagnosus_ghQ3AcbJ.html&#34;&gt;3.3 Diagnosus (.html with animated .gif)&lt;/a&gt; but we still didn’t recognize all the Pokémon until hint 3, at which point Google sufficed for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nowhere near the top, but compared to the usual results of whatever AoPS team I form, it’s amazing. By far the best result of AoPS was on CiSRA in 2010 (46th with 58 points), before I discovered puzzle hunts in AoPS; unfortunately due to people getting older and the influx of younger and younger people to the fora, there are less possible teammates each year and they have less time, so here I am by myself. (Also I could have accepted an invitation from a guy in the some-form-of-Elephant team, but I figure if you can win two MUMS hunts in a row you don’t need any more people.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all: Yay!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So winter vacation started and parents had planned a trip to southern Taiwan, to get closer to nature and walk around and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the MIT Mystery Hunt, the absolute granddaddy of all the other puzzlehunts in terms of age, structure, and size, happened this weekend. Originally, I didn’t have a team and just planned to look at the puzzles after they got archived and &lt;s&gt;try solving some puzzles&lt;/s&gt; read the solutions while constantly thinking, “How could anybody ever solve that?” Because of that, I wasn’t planning to even bring my laptop at first; then I could force myself to study some long-overdue ring theory during the nights. I was taken aback by a private message on Saturday morning from somebody with many different names inviting me to remote-solve for Random Thymes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes. I know it’s been more than a month. Blogging motivation decreases, but the responsibility of that &lt;em&gt;stay tuned&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t go away.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who knew coming up with strangely cryptic and illogical but nice-sounding post titles was so much fun!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this break in storytelling is mainly brought to you by generic summer laziness, as well as possibly a tiny bit of chemotherapy adverse effect. There is only a little perfectionism involved, and that’s because this post contains a long awkward situation (you might have guessed already). I guess this is what it feels like to have oodles of stuff to blog about, but not enough motivation. Heck, these few days with running the TAIMC have long filled my list of rant topics with juicy stories until it’s near-bursting. But I need to end this self-pity party before I get carried away, so… back to the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stranded in a foreign country at least 20 degrees Celsius below our comfort zone, having worn the same clothes for 36 hours of airplane travel, and still with less than 48 hours until the contest and &lt;em&gt;zero out of six compasses&lt;/em&gt;, we were running out of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick inventory of clothes showed that, after including the vests and caps in the backpacks we got, we probably had just enough clothes to survive the cruel frigid environment. So, reluctantly, we left the games room and hit the street to hunt down some underwear and socks to change into. Not to mention toothbrushes and some T-shirts and jackets for good measure, because the inside of the hotel was not the right temperature for full cold-resistance gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some haphazard wandering up and down the streets later, we found a store that suited our needs and picked up some clothes. The underwear came in two sizes: too loose and too tight. We picked the latter. Oh well, it would only be for a day or so… right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What happened to my majestic plans to go over every functional equation I failed on, ever? Or to go through a super-intense geometry-immersion period and actually try to develop some of that crazy “intuition” thing? And I have &lt;em&gt;finals&lt;/em&gt; coming up too! I just finished a ludicrous deadline-extended geography project that I am absolutely confident is the crappiest paper of my entire school career so far! And despite a semester of (slacking) classes, my Spanish is still only barely at a usable level! Exclamation marks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t panic… let’s focus on the positive. I am absolutely prepared with my stationery. I bought three spanking new 0.4mm pens that say “Can write for 1000 meters!” because all of my current ones are annoyingly thick and constantly having almost-but-not-quite run out, plus three new mechanical pencils and enough matching 2B lead to last me through college. All the pencils and lead are Pentel. I haven’t done any research, so if something terrible happens in Argentina I know what company to blame, and I am writing it here so I won’t confuse the brands. Also, in view of what happened to SCH’s carry-on baggage last year (luckily there was no geo on Day 1), I got an extra compass I hope won’t be needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’re listing all the &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; I have gotten ready:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Twitter Bandwagon</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;warning&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: My 2012 self wrote this. It is preserved for historical interest and amusement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha look at all the services&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ahem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you’ve been hiding under a rock for the last decade, Twitter is a platform for microblogging, i.e. blogging with very short posts, called tweets, which have to be under 140 characters after they shorten all the links for you for no reason, often after you’ve already shortened it once somehow-or-other. And yes, I hopped onto the bandwagon during procrastination. Everybody who matters on the technological edges of the internet seems to have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not arrogant enough to imagine I could compare Twitter to anything else authoritatively… I only barely count myself as using it. But a brief set of first impressions should be okay. Twitter is very public: you can see everybody’s tweets, who everybody is following, and who everybody is being followed by; the single privacy setting is a simple binary choice to lock up your account, so that everybody who wants to see what you posted needs your explicit authorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Facebook feed consists of entries such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;photographs of people I barely recognize, which I scroll past quickly… unless my mom comes up and says “Who is that?” and spends ten minutes looking at more such photos while asking me questions like “How do you go to the next picture?” or “Why is this photo so blurry?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;context-less fragments of some larger conversation, e.g. “LOL!” or “linglinglinggg” (copied verbatim from a status)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alerts of J. Random Person having taken a Personality Test or scored too many lines in Tetris&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta-Facebook infographics, like a cloud of your closest friends or number of status posts. I tend to… have an extraordinarily negative impression of the type of narcissistic achievement-reliant… &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;… who need rewards at every step, except that they seem to be &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt;… *sigh&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow my cousin deleted the Eragon game from his PSP. Ah well, it was fun while it lasted. Current project: get that secretary-problem paper done. It looks much nicer now, due to the references and big bold titles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Now and then I find myself lapsing into a bunch of 42-related questions. The most recent occurrence was the day before yesterday, and I decided that the meaning of life is to find your meaning of life. Since that would tautologically entail that I had already completed my meaning of life, I decided to reject it, even though it has a pretty nice ring to it. Some goals:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’m reconsidering. It’s not that boring. LOLZ. There it goes again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particulars… well, I got to play my cousin’s PSP. It was an instant like the instant when I saw the Krusty Kreme shop during our visit to Indonesia (shoot, my mouth is watering again), I found a very interesting game logo. A shining blue lowercase E. Most people would think of the Internet Explorer logo. But obviously, Microsoft is probably not affiliated with Nintendo or whatever company made PSPs; even then you can’t play Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have a life and I still don’t know what to do with it. I like making powerpoints, programming, typing tests, made-up hyperbolic IQ tests, Gmail, and odd things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that animation has gone to my nerves. And Bookworm Adventures pining. Best word so far: VORACIOUS, which earned me a blue gem tile, which froze somebody. I want to design games for PopCap too, because then I get to play the ones they already have for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got to sit and vegetate on a bus for a total of four hours. My MP4 was already getting boring. In fact the time spent at the math lesson was less than that. Luckily the bus home had a TV that kind of worked, and showed a replay of the show that self-translates as “One Million Star”. I only watched a bit. The rest was highly tumultuous slumber. Dinner was spaghetti, which helped.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got persuaded by my mom to seriously use the LearnToSpeak Spanish CD we bought. I say “Hasta luego” into the mic and it says I selected “Estoy bien”. Still, the vocabulary it selects are far better than the ones I selected haphazardly. ¿Qué quiere decir “…”? Well, I’m stopping the finding of new vocabulary in Spanish madly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I lost my Kitchen Midden rubric by clipping it into the questionnaires. I wasn’t sure until I found it there. I flipped through the questionnaires and found it in ten seconds. Wooooo! WHAT ARE THE ODDS? Luck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hooray! Something I ate today cured my cold! Well, they assuaged it for today at least. Perhaps by dinner I’ll be coughing like a donkey with terminal asthma again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, enough with horrible similes. Luckily or not, in P.E. class we didn’t do the lethal 100m dash timing. Instead we practiced jumping. Hooray! It’s not as exerting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After submitting my article onto my Magnum Opuses website section I got to drink some more pearl milk tea that wasn’t sweet at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was little I used to look at everybody drinking bitter things like tea, coffee, beer, wine, and all that. I simply couldn’t imagine growing up and liking them. Everything good at that time was sweet, sugary, sweet, and unhealthy. Then I realized that I hated candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am writing this post in 2018 because, as part of the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/remigration&#34;&gt;Big 2017 Remigration&lt;/a&gt;, I have decided to delete most of the posts because they were too embarrassing and sparse on information, but figured I might keep a rundown of the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, duh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just your typical Friday. Typical Fridays, we get computer class. And I can repeat it again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
