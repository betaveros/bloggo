	<p>Random video! Although I feel that I’ve heard it earlier, my first conscious memory of getting linked to it is from <a href="http://usamoarchive.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/youre-older-than-youve-ever-been/">this post</a>. At first I thought it would be the right background music for this post, but upon further reflection I think it mainly suited me while I was writing this post. Well, it’s topical if you mentally replace “day” with “year”.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/q2bo_u_YmW8" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
 </div>

<p>Anyway. Around this time a year ago, I paused my participation in big high-school competitions, for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, I stopped attempting to make IMO both because I wouldn’t get that much from the training and because other people ought to have the opportunity. I was concerned that I might condition myself to only be able to do math with the short-term motivation of contests. Better to focus on college math and maybe some original research, I thought. During the year, I did lots of the former and very little of the latter. Meh.</p>
<p>As for the IOI, my obvious next target: I was tired of training and going abroad while paranoid about whether my immune system would hold up. I didn’t feel that the IOI was worth that. To some degree, I also felt burned out about programming. Long story short, my treatment should end soon, and learning Haskell completely resolved the burnout problem.</p>
<p>But the most important reason, I think, was that “high school was too short”. I started math competitions ridiculously early and didn’t spend much time exploring other interests. I thought I knew myself well enough that I could say I didn’t have many more interests at all, but I was completely wrong (psych nerds will reflexively note this to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>). I coded lots in weird languages — Haskell, as mentioned previously, plus Scala, plus all manner of other magical command line tools. I wrote my first math problem and submitted it officially, picked up a new instrument, went to a debate competition, served as an unimportant tech guy for MUN, discovered and became hooked on Pentatonix, participated in three puzzle hunts in Australia and one in Massachusetts, figured out my rough political stance, rode a boat, got retweeted by <span class="citation" data-cites="eevee">@eevee</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Kyrgyzstan_News">@Kyrgyzstan_News</span>, increased my Neopets™ fortune by over 3400%, and lurked on FurAffinity a little too much.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Functional programming is terribly addicting! Partly I think the completely different way of thinking makes it feel like learning programming, and falling in love with it, all over again. Partly there’s this evil sense of satisfaction from using <code>$</code>s (and later <code>&lt;$&gt;</code>s and <code>=&lt;&lt;</code>s and <code>&amp;&amp;&amp;</code>s) to improve readability for initiated Haskellers and worsen it for everybody else. Partly it’s because <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/"><i>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</i></a> is such a fun read — there are too many funny bits to list but my favorite so far is when the author analyzes the first verse of Avril Lavigne’s <em>Girlfriend</em>.</p>
<p>Although I think my code in Haskell tends to be more readable than in other languages, code obfuscation in Haskell is almost natural: all you have to do is refactor the wrong function to be “pointfree”, which means that even though it’s a function that takes arguments, you define it without parameters by manipulating and joining a bunch of other functions. Example (plus a few other tiny obfuscations):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><div class="sourceLine" id="1" href="#1" data-line-number="1">isPrime <span class="fu">=</span> liftA2 (<span class="fu">&amp;&amp;</span>) (liftA2 (<span class="fu">$</span>) (all <span class="fu">.</span> ((<span class="fu">.</span>) (<span class="dv">0</span> <span class="fu">/=</span>)) <span class="fu">.</span> rem) (flip</div>
<div class="sourceLine" id="2" href="#2" data-line-number="2">    takeWhile [<span class="dv">2</span><span class="fu">..</span>] <span class="fu">.</span> (flip (<span class="fu">.</span>) <span class="fu">$</span> liftA2 (<span class="fu">*</span>) id id) <span class="fu">.</span> (<span class="fu">&gt;=</span>))) ((<span class="fu">&lt;</span>) <span class="dv">1</span>)</div></code></pre>
<p>QQ wordpress why no Haskell highlighting <ins>(Editor’s note from 2017: The migration should highlight this now!)</ins></p>
<p>Also, for some reason, you can do this in Haskell:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><div class="sourceLine" id="1" href="#1" data-line-number="1">ghci<span class="fu">&gt;</span> <span class="kw">let</span> <span class="dv">2</span> <span class="fu">+</span> <span class="dv">2</span> <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dv">5</span> <span class="kw">in</span> <span class="dv">2</span> <span class="fu">+</span> <span class="dv">2</span></div>
<div class="sourceLine" id="2" href="#2" data-line-number="2"><span class="dv">5</span></div></code></pre>
<p>(via <a href="http://www.yellosoft.us/evilgenius/">Haskell for the Evil Genius</a>)</p>
<hr />
<p>Okay, but seriously now. I wrote this about my journey to learn functional programming in the <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/programming">programming babble post</a> half a year ago:</p>
<blockquote>
The main obstacle I have is that it’s hard to optimize or get asymptotics when computation is expensive (a big problem if you’re trying to learn through Project Euler problems, particularly ones with lots of primes).

	<p>So, what have I been doing with programming recently?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> is an amazing multiparadigm programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and interoperates with Java. I learned about it last time reading random articles on Twitter.</p>
<p>When I say “amazing” I mean “This is a language in which my code gives me nerdgasms every time I read it.” Wheeee.</p>
<p>Okay, it’s not perfect. People say it’s too academic. It has a notoriously complicated type system (which is <a href="http://scientopia.org/blogs/goodmath/2013/01/21/types-gone-wild-ski-at-compile-time/"><em>Turing-Complete</em> at compile time</a>). Its documentation is a bit patchy too. For a serious introduction, the Scala website has plenty of links under documentation, and a <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/104">tour of features</a>. Somebody wrote <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/scalatour">another tour</a> that explains things a bit more. So here, instead of introducing it seriously, I’m just going to screw with its features.</p>
<p>Example of freedom. Scala lets names consist of symbols, and treats one-parameter methods and infix operators exactly the same. The full tokenization rules are a bit detailed and I put them at the bottom of this post for the interested. This lets you create classes with arithmetic and domain-specific languages easily, but it also creates some silly opportunities:</p>
<pre><code>scala&gt; val * = 12
*: Int = 12

scala&gt; * * * * *
res0: Int = 1728</code></pre>

	<p>Okay I don’t actually know how this pointless rambling got so long. I know the longer it is the more people will just tend to skim, because I do that all the time. So I went back and refactored—er, rewrote all the somewhat tangential bits (wow these puns are too easy) into footnotes. Manually. Obviously if I have to do this again I’ll write a script for it. But the post is still really long, and I bet nobody will read the whole thing. Oh well.</p>
<p>Life updates: I got out of the hospital Friday two-and-a-half weeks ago, went to the preliminaries of NPSC (a national team programming contest) with classmates, threw up a lot, went back into the hospital, and came out again. I wrote a lot of stuff about the experience and how much it sucked (hint: <em>a lot</em>) when I started this draft around that time, but now putting so much detail in this post feels weird. I’m mostly good now.</p>
<p>Three years ago NPSC was the only programming contest I really knew of; now I’ve participated in quite a few more, both online and locally, but it’s still the only contest I’ve entered that gives you real-time verdicts. I believe it inherits this from being modeled after ACM-ICPC, but that’s for college people and I’m less clear on how it works. All the other contests, namely <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/">TopCoder</a>, <a href="http://www.codeforces.com/">CodeForces</a>, <a href="http://usaco.org/">USACO</a>, and the other local individual competition (there doesn’t appear to be an English name so for the purpose of this post I’ll just call it “Nameless Local”; there’s a nation-wide competition in one-and-a-half weeks!), have system tests after the contest that don’t allow you to resubmit afterwards.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> They all give pretests that you get to know about right away, just to catch super-silly non-algorithmic mistakes like failing to remove the debug statements or reading input from the wrong place, but these contain weak test cases and don’t guarantee that the solution will pass the system tests and get full score.  After roughly parsing the rules on the IOI’s website, I believe the IOI (at least this year; I don’t know if it has evolved or anything) allows real-time testing and feedback with a confusing bunch of restrictions: how it apparently works is there are free “public tests”, and you can get results for a “release test” using the official test cases by using a “release token”, which you get two of every half hour. Additionally, there is apparently a cap of 64 submissions per problem, but I’m pretty sure it’s the kind of cap that honest competitors can safely ignore, like the 100-per-group in Australian puzzlehunts. Well, at least it tells us the organizers think in binary. Or octal.</p>

	<p>Okay did I mention how I sucked at the command line? This is part of the journey towards stopping. Yes, I’m on a Mac and it’s not very *nix-y in some ways but it’s enough for me for now.</p>
<p>Today’s story starts when I learned about <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/"><code>gdb</code></a>, the pure-command-line GNU Debugger, which is incredibly cool. I have tried and failed to learn how to use the debug function on many of my IDEs; I found shotgunning <code>printf</code> statements as needed faster. This may well be the first time I found a command-line tool so much more intuitive than the GUI-equipped programs. Wow.</p>

<p>Hardware:</p>
<p>The laptop I’m typing this on is over two years old. This is not a lot by some measures, but weird spontaneous glitches are starting to accumulate to the point where they’re getting on my nerves. The internet card still needs an extra reset to start working half the time, and occasionally warrants a full reboot, which costs five minutes. The USB ports are loopy, some windows just show up black when they feel like it, and there’s a steadily climbing whir in the background. I’m kind of anticipating the moment the whole thing just drops dead.</p>
<p>Well, I’m not about to run out of computers to use (there’s a noisy XP desktop that also barely works despite handling all our print jobs, but also one spanking new eight-core CPU laptop, which Dad considered a valuable enough investment (?)) but such a loss is still not something to be dismissed lightly. And the externalized cost is far more important and chilling. Who knows how many kids in the Congo had to mine coltan, or how much conflict has occurred over the crude oil, or what awful conditions those sweatshop-assembly workers are going through? Annie Leonard’s words still resonate with me from when we were first shown the video a year ago. Which is more recent than this laptop, so that doesn’t mean that much. I think a couple months ago I would have absolutely no second thoughts about getting a new one, though. Yup, I’m in a quandary (ha ha vocabulary) on the balance between desensitization and compulsive hoarding of stuff.</p>

	There are two big elementary and middle school competitions around this part of the globe. Well, “big” according to “I’ve heard of it”, which is by no means an accurate measure of, well, anything. I don’t go out of my way to look for them any more, even though… hold on, am I still eligible? Whatever. But in any case, diverting any unnecessary energy from the olympiad-proof-training is probably not a good idea now.
