	<p><strong>tl;dr: anybody want to add me on Line or tell/remind me about other phone chat apps? betaveros as always.</strong></p>
<p>Wow, talk about uninspired post titles.</p>
<p>I got a new phone today. Or, well, it’s second-hand, actually. I try to make electronics last a long time, but I think this was justified given the state of my last phone’s screen:</p>
<p><a href="/img/screen.jpg"><img src="/img/screen.jpg?w=269" alt="old phone screen, with a visibly malfunctioning black patch" width="269" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3142" /></a></p>
<p>Besides, I’m going off to college and all. Anyway, the phone is pretty cool. It’s a slick shade of red, it came with a cover and everything, and it has one of those fancy 3x3-grid locks. How secure are those again?</p>
<p>Well, we could just <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6979524/android-lock-password-combinations">find the answer on StackOverflow</a>, but that’s boring.</p>

	<p>(Frivolous blog content, posted as part of a <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">daily posting streak I have openly committed to</a>; standard disclaimers apply)</p>
<p>Out of boredom and curiosity, I <a href="https://betaveros.github.io/bars-college.html">graphed how many emails colleges sent me</a>, excluding the colleges I actually applied to. I am being extremely polite and just calling them emails. I’ve wanted to make this for a long time, but it wasn’t until I saw this <a href="https://medium.com/message/my-failed-experiment-in-time-travel-3aa2240a6bc0">post about an email experiment</a> on <a href="http://waxy.org/links/">waxy.org/links</a> that I understood which tools I could use to quantify my emails. (And then I actually made it and procrastinated posting it here for two months. If you look at my GitHub page or activity you might have seen it already, though. Oops.)</p>
<p>I don’t think the results were expected. Other than saying that, I leave the interpretation up to the reader because I’m on a tight blogging schedule. Cool? Cool.</p>

	<p>I started trying to sleep at 9 the night before the contest, tossed and turned in bed until 10, then fell asleep and got up at 3:35 in the morning. Blah. At that point, I went to the bathroom and applied some chapstick before trying to go back to sleep until 6. After breakfast, I grabbed a few minutes of sleep on the bus to the convention center where our contest would be, then slept on a sofa outside the actual contest hall alongside most of the rest of our team as we waited for a very long time until it was okay for us to enter. Competitions really mess with one’s sleep schedule.</p>
<p>Then, much too soon, we could enter. Day 1 of the contest was about to start.</p>
<p>The laptops were as yesterday, although they were protected with a white screensaver that indicated my name and ID as well as a countdown to the start of the contest. I was glad to see that my mousepad and all my writing utensils had survived without me. Somebody had the sense of humor to project an online stopwatch with an animated bomb fuse onto the screens to indicate the remaining time, which, once again, there was a lot of.</p>
<p>I conferred briefly with Paul (TZW (alphaveros (?))) about vim settings for a bit, but there were still fifteen minutes left or so. I idly stretched, practiced typing my <code>.vimrc</code> on an imaginary keyboard, and watched as the US dude two tables to my left unplugged his laptop’s mouse and rearranged absolutely everything on his table using the surface under his chair as swap space. (Well, that was how I mentally described it at the time, pending further revelations. (hint hint))</p>
<p>Then it began. </p>

	<p>Yes, I know day 1 of the contest already ended and is probably a more interesting topic to blog about, but I finished writing this last night just before the internet was cut off to quarantine the contestants from the leaders, who received the problems and began translating them. I didn’t know about this until it was too late, which is why I’ve been waiting since yesterday to post this.</p>
<p>To provide a counterpoint to the last post, one of the many, <em>many</em> advantages of entering an international competition is that you get to meet a lot more people you already know, so there’s less time spent being socially awkward. While waiting for stuff to happen, aside from all the expected time spent with the Taiwan team, I also talked to, played games with, and otherwise entertained a whole lot of people I already knew, including my schoolmates (no less than fourteen of them were volunteers) and some of the college students who had shepherded us around during olympiad training.</p>
<p>Which is a good thing, too, because there was a lot of waiting.</p>
<p>First I waited for my teammates; my parents had decided to take me to the hotel (Fullon Shenkeng) directly, since I had a lot of stuff, and I had arrived early. This took about an hour, after which we had lunch. Then I waited for the hotel to give us our room cards, which took about five hours, after which we had dinner. Finally, at night, I waited for the Codeforces system tests. Very nerve-wracking. But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>

	<p>Late post. As usual.</p>
<p>It started with an online competition — write programs, solve problems, get points. I wouldn’t call the problems easy, but they weren’t hard either. So I solved all of them. To make it even less impressive, only about twenty people submitted anything at all.</p>
<p>But the result was just what it was: I ended up with a free ticket to <a href="https://tw.pycon.org/2014apac/en/">PyCon APAC 2014</a>.</p>

	<p>After the first stage of selection camp, I was very nervous because I was fifth place in a selection sequence that would finally result in a team of four.</p>
<p>I screwed myself over on the first mock test by committing to a bad implementation method on a problem that was hard to get points on. My method seemed simple, but the memory usage leaked out in a way that was confusing and hard to patch; unfortunately, I tried to patch it in increasingly desperate and convoluted ways rather than scrapping the method, and thus missed out on many of the points elsewhere.</p>
<p>During the second test I failed to read the last problem carefully and spent too much of my time on the second problem, once again missing out on a lot of relatively easy points. I had optimized and optimized and pushed my quadratic runtime down to linearithmic, which would allow me to get the points for the last subtask — or so I thought. But with 10 minutes left I had all but one testcase right, and after desperately rereading my code, I realized that I had a string comparison stuck in an inner loop that could make my runtime degenerate to quadratic if the input string had lots of the same digit. In order to have a solidly linearithmic algorithm, I would have to implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_array">suffix array</a>. Ten minutes? I gave up. (The problem setters told me afterwards that hashing would have worked too; I didn’t think of that at all. Oops.) I spent the 10 minutes reading the last problem and still failed to read it carefully. So that did not go very well.</p>
<p>But, as the title probably gave away, during the third and fourth mock tests everything went much better than expected. :)  There are two good reasons:</p>

	<p>First Google Code Jam!</p>
<p>The format of this competition, allowing us to run programs on our own machines, brought up a very interesting issue for me: what programming language should I be using? (I had had similar considerations for IPSC 2013, but GCJ’s problems are closer to the traditional ACM-ICPC style.)</p>
<p>The obvious choice is C++, the language I use for roughly every other competition, but its safety (or lack thereof) is not very appealing. I need speed, but not <em>that much</em> speed. Unfortunately I still haven’t gotten around to learning any other friendlier mid-level languages (on the list: D, Go, or Rust), so I have no close substitutes for C++ right now.</p>
<p>Python is certainly available for a reliable arbitrary-length integer type, if nothing else.</p>
<p>As for non-candidates, Java has <code>BigInteger</code> and memory safety, but all in all I decided the benefits are too minor and it’s too ugly without operator overloading. Scala is probably way too slow. So I don’t expect to be writing either language.</p>
<p>The only difficult choice I have to make is, of course, Haskell — which can be quite fast, even while it’s ridiculously type-safe and expressive and referentially transparent and easy to reason about, once you’ve:</p>
<ul>
<li>figured out how to do the problem</li>
<li>scrapped step 1 and <em>actually</em> figured out how to do the problem <em>functionally</em></li>
<li>gotten the thing to compile</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if I can handle step 1, step 2 is by no means a simple task, as my struggle to implement a mere <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/haskell">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a> efficiently shows. That is fun, but not at all intuitive; I am doubtful I can do this under contest conditions. It is extremely difficult to transfer my skills in learning how to implement, say, a segment tree or treap into this language.</p>
<p>But! Google links to the <a href="http://www.go-hero.net/jam/10/round/0">programming language breakdown for 2010 Qualification Round</a> as an example, and much to my surprise, Haskell ranks somewhere between sixth and tenth place in popularity (depending on what you sort by), so there are functional superprogrammers who can presumably do something like this.</p>
<p>As it happens, I ended up implementing all four solutions to the qualification rounds in Haskell, because of the relaxed time limit and lack of any involved algorithms and data structures. I think it was worth it. </p>

	<p>Random video! Although I feel that I’ve heard it earlier, my first conscious memory of getting linked to it is from <a href="http://usamoarchive.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/youre-older-than-youve-ever-been/">this post</a>. At first I thought it would be the right background music for this post, but upon further reflection I think it mainly suited me while I was writing this post. Well, it’s topical if you mentally replace “day” with “year”.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/q2bo_u_YmW8" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
 </div>

<p>Anyway. Around this time a year ago, I paused my participation in big high-school competitions, for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, I stopped attempting to make IMO both because I wouldn’t get that much from the training and because other people ought to have the opportunity. I was concerned that I might condition myself to only be able to do math with the short-term motivation of contests. Better to focus on college math and maybe some original research, I thought. During the year, I did lots of the former and very little of the latter. Meh.</p>
<p>As for the IOI, my obvious next target: I was tired of training and going abroad while paranoid about whether my immune system would hold up. I didn’t feel that the IOI was worth that. To some degree, I also felt burned out about programming. Long story short, my treatment should end soon, and learning Haskell completely resolved the burnout problem.</p>
<p>But the most important reason, I think, was that “high school was too short”. I started math competitions ridiculously early and didn’t spend much time exploring other interests. I thought I knew myself well enough that I could say I didn’t have many more interests at all, but I was completely wrong (psych nerds will reflexively note this to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>). I coded lots in weird languages — Haskell, as mentioned previously, plus Scala, plus all manner of other magical command line tools. I wrote my first math problem and submitted it officially, picked up a new instrument, went to a debate competition, served as an unimportant tech guy for MUN, discovered and became hooked on Pentatonix, participated in three puzzle hunts in Australia and one in Massachusetts, figured out my rough political stance, rode a boat, got retweeted by <span class="citation" data-cites="eevee">@eevee</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Kyrgyzstan_News">@Kyrgyzstan_News</span>, increased my Neopets™ fortune by over 3400%, and lurked on FurAffinity a little too much.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Functional programming is terribly addicting! Partly I think the completely different way of thinking makes it feel like learning programming, and falling in love with it, all over again. Partly there’s this evil sense of satisfaction from using <code>$</code>s (and later <code>&lt;$&gt;</code>s and <code>=&lt;&lt;</code>s and <code>&amp;&amp;&amp;</code>s) to improve readability for initiated Haskellers and worsen it for everybody else. Partly it’s because <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/"><i>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</i></a> is such a fun read — there are too many funny bits to list but my favorite so far is when the author analyzes the first verse of Avril Lavigne’s <em>Girlfriend</em>.</p>
<p>Although I think my code in Haskell tends to be more readable than in other languages, code obfuscation in Haskell is almost natural: all you have to do is refactor the wrong function to be “pointfree”, which means that even though it’s a function that takes arguments, you define it without parameters by manipulating and joining a bunch of other functions. Example (plus a few other tiny obfuscations):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><div class="sourceLine" id="1" href="#1" data-line-number="1">isPrime <span class="fu">=</span> liftA2 (<span class="fu">&amp;&amp;</span>) (liftA2 (<span class="fu">$</span>) (all <span class="fu">.</span> ((<span class="fu">.</span>) (<span class="dv">0</span> <span class="fu">/=</span>)) <span class="fu">.</span> rem) (flip</div>
<div class="sourceLine" id="2" href="#2" data-line-number="2">    takeWhile [<span class="dv">2</span><span class="fu">..</span>] <span class="fu">.</span> (flip (<span class="fu">.</span>) <span class="fu">$</span> liftA2 (<span class="fu">*</span>) id id) <span class="fu">.</span> (<span class="fu">&gt;=</span>))) ((<span class="fu">&lt;</span>) <span class="dv">1</span>)</div></code></pre>
<p>QQ wordpress why no Haskell highlighting <ins>(Editor’s note from 2017: The migration should highlight this now!)</ins></p>
<p>Also, for some reason, you can do this in Haskell:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><div class="sourceLine" id="1" href="#1" data-line-number="1">ghci<span class="fu">&gt;</span> <span class="kw">let</span> <span class="dv">2</span> <span class="fu">+</span> <span class="dv">2</span> <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dv">5</span> <span class="kw">in</span> <span class="dv">2</span> <span class="fu">+</span> <span class="dv">2</span></div>
<div class="sourceLine" id="2" href="#2" data-line-number="2"><span class="dv">5</span></div></code></pre>

<p>Okay, but seriously now. I wrote this about my journey to learn functional programming in the <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/programming">programming babble post</a> half a year ago:</p>
<blockquote>
The main obstacle I have is that it’s hard to optimize or get asymptotics when computation is expensive (a big problem if you’re trying to learn through Project Euler problems, particularly ones with lots of primes).

	<p>Okay I don’t actually know how this pointless rambling got so long. I know the longer it is the more people will just tend to skim, because I do that all the time. So I went back and refactored—er, rewrote all the somewhat tangential bits (wow these puns are too easy) into footnotes. Manually. Obviously if I have to do this again I’ll write a script for it. But the post is still really long, and I bet nobody will read the whole thing. Oh well.</p>
<p>Life updates: I got out of the hospital Friday two-and-a-half weeks ago, went to the preliminaries of NPSC (a national team programming contest) with classmates, threw up a lot, went back into the hospital, and came out again. I wrote a lot of stuff about the experience and how much it sucked (hint: <em>a lot</em>) when I started this draft around that time, but now putting so much detail in this post feels weird. I’m mostly good now.</p>
<p>Three years ago NPSC was the only programming contest I really knew of; now I’ve participated in quite a few more, both online and locally, but it’s still the only contest I’ve entered that gives you real-time verdicts. I believe it inherits this from being modeled after ACM-ICPC, but that’s for college people and I’m less clear on how it works. All the other contests, namely <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/">TopCoder</a>, <a href="http://www.codeforces.com/">CodeForces</a>, <a href="http://usaco.org/">USACO</a>, and the other local individual competition (there doesn’t appear to be an English name so for the purpose of this post I’ll just call it “Nameless Local”; there’s a nation-wide competition in one-and-a-half weeks!), have system tests after the contest that don’t allow you to resubmit afterwards.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> They all give pretests that you get to know about right away, just to catch super-silly non-algorithmic mistakes like failing to remove the debug statements or reading input from the wrong place, but these contain weak test cases and don’t guarantee that the solution will pass the system tests and get full score.  After roughly parsing the rules on the IOI’s website, I believe the IOI (at least this year; I don’t know if it has evolved or anything) allows real-time testing and feedback with a confusing bunch of restrictions: how it apparently works is there are free “public tests”, and you can get results for a “release test” using the official test cases by using a “release token”, which you get two of every half hour. Additionally, there is apparently a cap of 64 submissions per problem, but I’m pretty sure it’s the kind of cap that honest competitors can safely ignore, like the 100-per-group in Australian puzzlehunts. Well, at least it tells us the organizers think in binary. Or octal.</p>
