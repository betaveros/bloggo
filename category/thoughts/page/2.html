	<p>This post’s topic might be the most controversial thing I’ve posted here ever. I hope the points I want to make aren’t.</p>
<p>One of the excuses for not blogging I came up with and then deleted while <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/no-excuses">rambling about not blogging</a> was that I’m getting more feelings about real-world real-person issues, things that people take heated positions on — it’s not topics like what food I ate or what games I’m playing in fourth grade any more — and my identity is pretty public here, so who knows what’ll happen. Oh well. I’m probably just paranoid.</p>
<p>It’s also delayed, as the articles I’m talking about are old; the latest two news items are the shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile and then the police shooting at the Dallas rally. That was also really sad, but I don’t think I have anything insightful to say about it. Let me point you to the <a href="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/black-lives-matter">MIT Admissions post, “Black Lives Matter”</a>, and then for something a bit more optimistic out of a huge range of possible choices, <a href="https://medium.com/@Mandela/my-white-boss-talked-about-race-in-america-and-this-is-what-happened-fe10f1a00726#.wtnr99lp1">this Medium article</a>.</p>
<p>Although after I started writing this post, the story about <a href="http://www.indiatimes.com/news/world/muslim-man-hugs-isis-militant-armed-wearing-suicide-vest-before-explosion-saves-hundreds-of-lives-258126.html">a Muslim man preventing an ISIS suicide bomber</a> came out, so now this is mildly relevant again. Anyway, I guess the delay is no different from how I put up life posts weeks after the life event happens. So today, I bring you two old news articles about Islam that my friends shared and discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Green: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/todd-green-phd/is-islam-responsible-for-_b_10449060.html">Is Islam Responsible For The Orlando Nightclub Shooting?</a>
</li>
<li>
King: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/king-isis-terrorists-aren-muslims-evil-men-article-1.2699463">ISIS terrorists aren’t Muslims — they’re just evil men hell-bent on carnage and destruction</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The second one first, whose argument is, to be frank, weak. I think this piece from <cite>The Atlantic</cite> by Wood, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/">“What ISIS Really Wants”</a>, is a better-researched overview of ISIS while still being pretty readable. One caveat is that it’s somewhat old. But its central claim is quite the opposite:</p>

	<p>One of the most unexpectedly different facets of life during my internship has been the meals.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about the food; it’s certainly different in a fantastic way (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/DropboxTuckShop/?fref=ts">Dropbox’s food (link to Facebook page)</a> is like something out of a high-end restaurant), but I knew that before coming already. Also of note is the way I started eating ∞% more ramen over the weekends than I did over the entire school year at MIT, because here I can’t buy that many groceries without them spoiling and am amazingly lazy in this new environment.</p>
<p>No, this (deadlined, so not that well-thought-out, but whatever) post is about conversations at meals, which happen basically every lunch and some dinners when my team eats together.</p>
<p>I’ve never had any regular experience like it. Of course I’ve had many meals at home with family, but they feel different because, well, it’s family and we have so many topics in common. I went to the same school for twelve years and we didn’t generally use a cafeteria; we just ate at our desks in our classrooms, or while doing things like attending club meetings or taking makeup tests. Sometimes if people felt like it they would push desks together to eat, but eating by oneself was totally normal. (At last, I feel like that was what it was. It seems so far away now that I don’t trust my memory, which is pretty sad… I faintly suspect I would have this experience in a more stereotypical American high school. But this is mostly just based off the cafeteria in <cite>Mean Girls</cite>, a movie I only watched in its entirety on the flight here, which is weird because I know I’ve seen the “The limit does not exist!” part much much earlier. /aside)</p>
<p>And at MIT? “Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.”</p>
<p>I am glad for these conversations over lunch because I get to know my team more personally (and don’t have to awkwardly eat alone in the bathroom), but they’ve also given me a lot of time to ponder my (lack of) conversation skills.</p>

	<p>(I’m making random short posts to entertain certain people during spring break.)</p>
<p>Since air-dropping into this crazy cultural salad bowl of a place, I’ve met a lot of people whose names get mispronounced. All sorts of long vowels and short vowels and consonants and word boundaries that jump across languages unpredictably. As a result, people often acquire nicknames or alternative names to get called by, whether actively, passively, or somewhere in between.</p>
<p>In contrast, my name is easy and boring. Now, I rather doubt I’d want an exciting name, in the sense of a name that everybody mangles in excitingly different ways. I’m not exactly dissatisfied with people calling me “Brian”. It just strikes me that I think I’ve gone my entire life without a meaningful nickname or even meaningful derivative of my name.</p>
<p>(I’m ignoring the transposition. Why am I ignoring the transposition? I’m not sure I can rationally justify that, but thinking about it makes me cringe, which is the reason I’m delicately avoiding explicitly writing out what nickname I refer to by “transposition”. I will just say it is rather uninspired… and also, perplexingly to me, used by accident a lot…)</p>

	<p>(So. It’s spring break. Two-week-late post, and somehow by the end it’s all aboard the angst train again?)</p>
<p>Two Sundays ago, I mobbed with a small group of MIT furries to watch <cite>Zootopia</cite>, the recent highly-reputed Disney movie.</p>
<p>(Before anything else, first there were the previews. I was impressed that every single one of them — there were six or so — was about an upcoming movie featuring anthropomorphic animals front and center. Let me see if I can remember all of them… in no particular order, <cite>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</cite>, <cite>The Secret Life of Pets</cite>, <cite>The Jungle Book</cite>, <cite>Storks</cite>, <cite>Finding Dory</cite>, and <cite>Ice Age: Collision Course</cite>. <ins datetime="2016-04-09T05:10:42+00:00">edit: Oh, also <cite>Angry Birds</cite>.</ins> Wow, I said, they know their audience.)</p>
<p>I went into the movie with a vague impression that <cite>Zootopia</cite> was more adult-oriented than most Disney films — not in the naughty way, but in general making a lot of jokes and invoking a lot of parallels that I think only adults might have the experience to get. My suspicions were confirmed a few lines into the movie, where there was a joke about taxes I cracked up at but can’t imagine that children a few years younger would have found funny. If you the reader haven’t watched it, I hope that was vague enough not to ruin the start for you.</p>
<p>(To be fair — and, uh, some parts of the internet are kind of big on this fact — the film also at one point enters a nudist colony. Fortunately (?), <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsLackAttributes">Animals Lack Attributes</a>.)</p>
<p>Humor aside, I think the movie also deals with some weighty and nuanced themes, ones that would take more life experience to fully appreciate than the themes of most Disney movies. The social commentary is very clear. Possibly bordering on too blatant for my tastes — even though the whole movie is kind of Funny Talking Animals, there are some animal species for which it’s really easy to guess which human demographic groups they might be symbolizing, to the point where I can already imagine the other side of the debate. You won’t need a PhD in literature to figure out the parallels; you wouldn’t even need an AP English Literature class. But, I think, it still works. It’s like <cite>Animal Farm</cite> on training wheels.</p>

	<p>There are 30 minutes until my laundry finishes.</p>
<p>It is 2:30 in the morning as I write this. Normal people are not awake at this time of day. It’s possible that normal MIT students are, though.</p>
<p>I’ve been meaning to blog for a while, but things happen and other things happen and still more things happen. From a state of total inexperience in the kitchen, I’ve already managed to single-handedly cook six six-person meals for my co-op, not to mention all the weird meals I make for myself (which is just as well, I don’t think they are of typically mentionable caliber.) I’ve already taken two exams in three of my classes and the big midterm for my fourth. Four puzzlehunts — Simmons, aquarium, Palantir, ΣUMS; five if you perhaps include Next Haunt. Six SIPB meetings. A few bottles of Soylent; I lost count and don’t want to check my room because that’ll disturb my roommate. Θ(3000) zephyrs. And after many weekends of eye-opening group practice, tonight I have to catch a flight to Rochester, NY for ACM-ICPC regionals.</p>

	<p>As readers of this blog probably know, I am not an MITAdmissions blogger. It was kind of disappointing at the moment, but now I rarely think about it except when I come up with good reasons why I shouldn&rsquo;t be an MITAdmissions blogger. One reason is that I am not very good at coming up with advice that could generalize to a wide audience, even an audience only as wide as people at or coming to the &lsquo;Tvte. <em>(There can be only one!)</em> This by itself probably wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad because there&rsquo;s plenty of generalizable advice to go around, but I also don&rsquo;t like repeating well-known stuff. Don&rsquo;t skip class, except when you really know when you&rsquo;re doing, which you probably think you do when you skip class. Get enough sleep, maintain good study habits, set aside time to keep up with old friends, back up your zarking data, alternate alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks, do not forget the factor of one-half when computing the area of a triangle. You get the picture.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s only one piece of advice I can say that I believe is generalizable to any degree, and in particular I think my past self would have appreciated and also had not heard, even in passing, from any other source: Get a Sharpie.</p>

	<p>(Short <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/commitment">streak</a> post. And for the uninformed, I’m using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spivak_pronoun">Spivak pronouns</a> for this post just because.)</p>
<p>Generally, when people I don’t already know through math competitions ask me or my parents about something like how to teach their intelligent child to make em really good at math, or even English or whatever, I am skeptical by default because there seem to be a lot of Taiwanese parents who have alarmingly rigid and largely baseless expectations or assumptions about what their children ought to be interested in and excel at.</p>
<p>You can lead a horse to water, and honestly I think you could find a way to force it to drink if you really wanted to, but you can’t make it enjoy the process of being force-fed. Um. <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/36489/eat-is-to-feed-as-drink-is-to-what">Force-watered? Force-hydrated?</a></p>
<p>You can teach your child math and English, and you could make em ace all eir tests, but you probably can’t make em enjoy the test so much that e decides to create more diabolical versions of these tests to give to eir fictional characters in eir stories for fun!</p>
<p>These are all <strong><em>actual illustrations</em></strong> from the old stories I mentioned in <a href="https://betaveros.wordpress.com/2015/07/24/more-fiction-part-2-5/">part 2.5 of “More Fiction”</a>. Stories I wrote in 2004. As a first-grader.</p>
<p>This is kind of horrifying.</p>

	<p>This is not Part 3. It’s just two things I thought of tacking on to <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/more-fiction-2">part 2</a>.</p>
<p>What can I say? Part 2s are easy blog post fodder; Part 2 appendixes are even easier.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One, there’s one other wall I run into often during those rare attempts when I get motivated enough to try to write a story: naming characters is hard. At least, it provides an excellent motivational roadblock whenever I even consider committing a story to paper, a point before I’ve actually written anything at which I think “maybe I should give up and go on Facebook instead” and proceed to do so. Aggh. And I think there’s more than one reason for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
I have trouble coming up with names to some degree. Sure, it’s easy to browse BabyNames.com and look for choices, but a lot of the names there are really weird and contemplating them for every unimportant character kind of rips me out of the immersed mindset.
</li>
<li>
Reading great stories in English class and elsewhere may have gotten me feeling like every name ought to be a deep meaningful allusion, or at least pun fodder. I feel like I will regret it if I write a story and, a few months and/or chapters down the road, realize I missed a better name or the name I chose has some undesirable connotations in context or provides an atmosphere-ruining coincidence.
</li>
<li>
<p>But I think the real kicker is simply that some part of me is terrified of the awkwardness of giving a character the same name as anybody I know, because then they might read the story and wonder if the character is somehow based on them. And too many of the names that I consider common enough to not lure readers off into looking for hidden meanings are used up that way. This is obviously worst if the character is an antagonist. But it seems just as awkward if the character is a protagonist in accord with everything I’ve written, i.e. a paper-thin character blatantly created for escapist purposes. I am already kind of terrified I might ever meet anybody with the same name as one of my mentally established characters even though I haven’t actually written anything about him. And there’s a well-established convention of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">not reusing a first name in a work</a>, so this gets even harder with every work; I’m just as worried, what if somebody thinks this character is related to the other character in that story I wrote in second grade? Oh no!!</p>
<p>It’s like not reusing variable names in a programming language where everything is in the same scope. Positively nightmarish.</p>
And I actually discovered some evidence this is a thing in my past: I found some stories I wrote in 2004. They are possibly the most extreme exemplification of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhatYouKnow">Write What You Know</a> imaginable: the main character, Michael, goes to school and makes friends. That’s all.

<figcaption>
Illustration courtesy Brian<sub>2004</sub>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I kind of want to share these stories, but fast-forward a few years and you’ll see that a classmate named Michael entered my grade and we stayed in the same grade until we graduated.</p>
<p>Hi, Michael. You’re probably not reading this, but the character I created in 2004 is not in any way based on or inspired by you, especially not this image. And unlike later in this post where I name a character after myself, I’m not being sarcastic, really.</p>
See, this is awkward.

	<p>All through high school I had really high standards for myself. Not the grades, mind you (I admit, humblebrag, my grades were always uncomfortably high, probably as an expected but still sad byproduct of this process (yes, I’m actually complaining about grades being too high. I don’t want my report card to have lots of Bs or Cs, but I really didn’t need to pour enough resources into schoolwork that I graduated as valedictorian, when there were so many other personally and socially meaningful things I could be dedicating effort into creating — but that’s a subject for another post (humblebrags all the way down. Somebody get some internet pitchforks and poke some sense into me))), but simply how I managed my time for doing homework.</p>
<p>In my opinion: not very well. I always spent too much time surfing the internet and doing things less urgent than homework, then ended up sleeping at midnight or one o’clock or whenever often to finish what I should have done earlier.</p>
<p>And yet, compared to many of my friends (definitely not all, though), that’s not late at all and the amount of buffer time I had between finishing work and having it due was positively luxurious. But then, I suppose, I didn’t have the same amount of math homework. But to counter my excuse, I had additional responsibilities such as practicing olympiad problems and preparing weekend presentations and translating the school newsletter. So I don’t actually know if my workload was significantly lighter than average or not, ergo I don’t know whether my time management skills were significantly better than average or not. It seriously doesn’t feel like they would be.</p>
<p>And allegedly, even when I’m procrastinating, it’s more productive than my friends’ procrastination, maybe even <a href="http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html">Paul Graham’s good type of procrastination</a>. Often when I gripe about how much my former self procrastinated they will ask me what I’ve been doing and, after hearing the answer, tell me this. What have I done to put off homework? Oh, I did some olympiad math problems, committed to my GitHub projects, read a bunch of programming blogs, organized my old chemistry notes from two years ago, and surfed the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Yeah. Total waste of time. Meanwhile certain friends surf 9GAG whenever they get the chance. (Which is not to say that I don’t procrastinate in obviously unproductive ways sometimes — I surf reddit, YouTube, and TVTropes of course. Sometimes I even just read my own blog or dig through old folders in my computer. I’m weird. But anyway.)</p>
