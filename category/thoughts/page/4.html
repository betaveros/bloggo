<p><strong>Note</strong> from the future, 2017-11-25: I am fairly unhappy with this rant as it stands — it makes many points I still agree with, but it just sounds sooo pretentious — but it is one of very few posts to actually receive a link from an external post I’m aware of, so I am letting it stand for historical interest. I wrote this years ago; please don’t take it out of context.</p>
</div>
<p>I have to admit, I got unhealthily worked up about getting this score.</p>
<p>For the purposes of college, I only ever wanted a score that wouldn’t be a deal-breaker — anything above 2300 would be enough. Any other time I had left would be better spent in other endeavors. Such endeavors might help on the college app, but more importantly, I’d also get to enjoy them.</p>
So why am I here? Partly it’s because my classmates got worked up about it. Somebody specifically requested me to post my score somewhere. And partly it’s because there couldn’t be a better way at the moment to establish my authority to (yet again) rant against standardized tests here.

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I wrote this in 2013. It seems too irreverent in places when I look back, and not quite in the way that I’d like, but maybe it’s kind of amusing anyway?</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> just because a significant number of people in group A (esp. of a certain race/ethnicity) also have quality B does not mean that (i) all or most people of group A have quality B or (ii) people of group A who do not have quality B are in any way strange or inferior.</p>
<p>In other words, stereotypes are stupid; don’t apply them to real people.</p>
<p>The stereotypical “Asian” (a person from “Asia”, a mythical faraway continent consisting of two countries, China and Japan) is too hard-working, gets disowned for any grade below an A, has infinitesimally thin eyeslits, and pronounces L’s and R’s identically.</p>

</figure>
<p>The internet says the L/R thing is mostly due to Japanese having only a single sound somewhere in between those two. Wikipedia has a page on Japanese phonology which seems to support this. Still, Wikipedia articles on phonology all consist of giving every sound a long incomprehensible name, such as the “apical postalveolar flap undefined for laterality” for the Japanese sound discussed above, and I’m not Japanese, so don’t take my word for it.</p>

	<p>Sometimes, a sentiment randomly appears in my brain. I wonder about it. There’s a draft I’ve worked on because I’m trying to get something out of my bubble. My emotions are confusing and they need to be released.</p>
<p>And after a few sentences, they’ve been released, but the post’s not out there because I want to polish it. First it’s just a look-over for typoes or grammar, then maybe I want to get the flow of the sentences right or cut down the embarrassing bits.</p>
<p>Then, on the third read-over, I don’t know why I’m writing it anymore.</p>

<p>For some reason, everybody around here seems to think that adding English characters, no matter how broken or meaningless, confers an added sense of quality or superiority. I don’t really understand the mindset here but it’s the only explanation I can come up with. It’s certainly not to make the lives of our English-speaking population any easier.</p>

<p>I have a life and I still don’t know what to do with it. I like making powerpoints, programming, typing tests, made-up hyperbolic IQ tests, Gmail, and odd things.</p>
<p>All that animation has gone to my nerves. And Bookworm Adventures pining. Best word so far: VORACIOUS, which earned me a blue gem tile, which froze somebody. I want to design games for PopCap too, because then I get to play the ones they already have for free.</p>

<p>Biking is fun. Unfortunately it doesn’t require as much exertion as other workout methods do. The thing you learn most from it is how to obey traffic.</p>

<p>Recent excercise: I’ve bicycled all over the place, almost going into Jhubei. Obviously, with parental notice. In fact they rode with me. Or, more strictly speaking I rode with them. Whatever. Also I’ve done a few pushups wrongly. And I’m typing, I guess. Ah, whatever.</p>
