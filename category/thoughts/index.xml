      <title>Me and Facebook</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr: I don’t use Facebook much. If you want to contact me, I would prefer nearly any other mode of communication. I am also going to stop autosharing posts from this blog onto Facebook. RSS readers are great; get yours today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I checked Facebook and it said something like “You’ve added N friends this past T units of time! Thanks for making the world more connected!” and I just couldn’t any more. Facebook friends are not friends. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar&#39;s_number&#34;&gt;Dunbar’s number&lt;/a&gt; is around 150, maybe double that if you want to stretch it; humans cannot handle that many human relationships. Facebook’s siloed ecosystem is the opposite of connected with the rest of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is one of many reasons I pretty much don’t use Facebook any more. This is not new, but I’ve never formalized it. Also, I figure others might assume otherwise since I still do have an account and still accept friend requests and post sometimes. Thus, I’m writing this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are all of the reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It&#39;s Complicated</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/complicated</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On November 8th, 2016, Donald Trump was elected the 45th President of the United States. Along with a Republican House and Senate majority, to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world around me is still hurting and reeling from the shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, I am scared. I am scared of the policies and executive orders and legal decisions to come that may strip away many civil rights and send the environment down a worse track faster than anyone expected, and I’m barely in any of the groups that have the most to lose. I have no idea what it’s like to go through this as any of you. I am sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am also scared that this fear is driving my friends and my community away from talking to the people we need to talk to if we want to make sure this doesn’t happen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard a lot of people vilify Trump and Trump supporters. &lt;a href=&#34;https://nmnnmnnmmnnnmnrnmnmnnmn.wordpress.com/2016/11/09/1067/&#34;&gt;Anecdotally, so have others&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an understandable reaction, but a fragile one. 60 million people voted for Trump. &lt;a href=&#34;http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/11/its-going-to-be-okay.html&#34;&gt;Quoting &lt;em&gt;Wait But Why&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “[P]eople with kids and parents and jobs and dogs and calendars on their wall with piano lessons and doctors appointments and birthday parties written in the squares. Full, three-dimensional people who voted for what they hope will be a better future for themselves and their family.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People voted for Trump. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-base-is-blue-collar-his-voters-looking-for-a-return-to-better-times/&#34;&gt;FiveThirtyEight profiling a few blue-collar voters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/08/a-new-theory-for-why-trump-voters-are-so-angry-that-actually-makes-sense/&#34;&gt;The Washington Post interviewing an author who spent a lot of time in rural Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/us/politics/the-women-who-helped-donald-trump-to-victory.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;amp;smtyp=cur&#34;&gt;The New York Times on women&lt;/a&gt;. If the articles’ reasons for voting Trump could be summarized in one word, it would certainly be “economy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then FiveThirtyEight tempers it a little bit with this reminder that &lt;a href=&#34;http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/&#34;&gt;Trump’s supporters are on average more well-off than others&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/11/george-saunders-goes-to-trump-rallies&#34;&gt;The New Yorker visiting a bunch of Trump rallies&lt;/a&gt;. SupChina discusses &lt;a href=&#34;http://supchina.com/2016/11/03/many-first-generation-chinese-immigrants-supporting-donald-trump/&#34;&gt;first-generation Chinese immigrants supporting Trump&lt;/a&gt; and racism is a bullet point there, but apparently it’s partly rallied around rap lyrics about robbery that advise to “find a Chinese neighborhood” to steal from, so…? I am not going to go any deeper into this rabbit hole. Then here’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/03/trump-voters-are-not-angry-about-economy-really&#34;&gt;Mother Jones arguing against the economy being a big factor at all&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/15/13286498/donald-trump-voters-race-economic-anxiety&#34;&gt;Vox saying it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; about racial resentment&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-11-11/revenge-of-the-deplorables&#34;&gt;Bloomberg on the Clinton campaign’s failure to persuade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://thefederalist.com/2016/11/11/how-jon-stewart-and-the-daily-show-elected-donald-trump/&#34;&gt;The Federalist on “hyper-liberal late-night comedy”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/9/donald-trump-and-the-new-american-revolution/&#34;&gt;The Washington Times on Trump’s optimism&lt;/a&gt;. I could find hundreds more out there just by Googling, and so could you; and chances are if you’re enough of a voracious reader to be reading my humble blog, you’ve already read some of these.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Time, Money, and All That Good Stuff: Part 1 of ∞</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/time-money-1</link>

      <description>I had this 5,000-word draft, but I half-abandoned it for being sappy, boring, pointless, and impossible to rewrite to be satisfactorily un-cringeworthy. Instead, let me just tell you a couple random stories and anecdotes that went somewhere near the start. Maybe posting them will motivate me to salvage something from the 4,500 words that go after it and post it. Eventually.
Some time ago, Namecheap had a discount, so I bought a domain name for 88¢.</description>

      <title>Musings on Time Pressure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hate doing things under time pressure, but I have to admit I do a lot more things when time pressure exists. One of the things is writing. Another is posting the things I write. They aren’t very good, but they’re better than writing that doesn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(in case you forgot, I’m still posting this pretty much only because &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/no-excuses&#34;&gt;I made myself post once every weekend&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting that I can impose time pressure on myself by declaring commitment devices by fiat and it works. Other people have developed other methods of doing this — I recently discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.themostdangerouswritingapp.com/&#34;&gt;The Most Dangerous Writing App&lt;/a&gt;, which puts time pressure on you to type every five seconds or it deletes everything you wrote. There are many other ways it’s done.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have this memory —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a tiny kid, lying in bed and trying to fall asleep, and I started thinking about death and nonexistence, and I thought about how one day I wouldn’t exist any more, that there wouldn’t &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; a me thinking my thoughts and perceiving my perspective, and suddenly I was terrified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got up and knocked on my parents’ bedroom door and asked them about this. Maybe. Or maybe I didn’t because the fear was less crippling than the social awkwardness of randomly knocking on my parents’ door in the middle of the night to ask them a question like that; I don’t remember. It was a long time ago, okay?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Music II</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/music-ii</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first made myself commit to posting weekly, I was trying to make myself spend a little time every day of the week thinking and writing and whittling away at old drafts. Instead I’m here at 10:40 PM basically starting a brand-new post. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I last &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/music&#34;&gt;blogged about music in 2013&lt;/a&gt;. I tagged two other posts with “music” since then, but neither is particularly deep: &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/8-songs&#34;&gt;8 Songs for 18 Years&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/drop-in&#34;&gt;Drop-In Filler&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s continue the tradition of self-analysis part IIs from nowhere…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I meditated a little bit in &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/conversations&#34;&gt;Conversations&lt;/a&gt; about “lacking experience or interest in a lot of the commonly discussed culture.” I think this applies to me and music as well, although not as fully. Back in Taiwan, when mentally bracing myself for coming to the U.S. for college, I sometimes worried about not knowing enough about pop music and bands and not listening enough to popular albums, and having trouble integrating into the culture for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, among the communities I wandered into and friends I made, it was a more frequent obstacle that I didn’t know enough about classical music and composers. Whoops. Some of the names rang faint bells from either music class or conversations with high school friends who did do classical music, but I could not identify or remember any styles or eras, and would remember composers only by unreliable first letters or unusual substrings of their names.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s another weekend, isn’t it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m out of deep things to say. I don’t usually have deep things to say. Sorry to anybody who subscribed hoping for more things like the last post. This is basically going to be a personal stream of consciousness post. But it’s a stream with a long ancestry, since I apparently wrote 400 words about it in a WordPress draft four years ago. This was way back before I even started writing post drafts in Markdown on my computer instead of directly in WordPress, so I guess it must be an interesting topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, Brian&lt;sub&gt;2012&lt;/sub&gt; was suddenly struck by how many of the people he knew were such serious gamers. But let’s go back even earlier, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long long time ago, when I was in elementary school or so, my parents had some sort of reward system where I had to do productive things, like study or do chores or write diary entries or practice the piano or something, to earn time on the computer for games. “Gaming time” was a currency. I enjoyed saving up lots of thirty-minute increments and knowing I had the freedom to using them slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That much I remember; the details of how it worked are very fuzzy and I’m not sure what I played in those thirty-minute increments either. I think there was Neopets and Runescape and Club Penguin. (My Neopets account still sees sporadic activity, because I get really really bored sometimes…)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Islam, Headlines, and Definitions</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/islam-headlines</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2016 15:29:43 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/islam-headlines</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post’s topic might be the most controversial thing I’ve posted here ever. I hope the points I want to make aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the excuses for not blogging I came up with and then deleted while &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/no-excuses&#34;&gt;rambling about not blogging&lt;/a&gt; was that I’m getting more feelings about real-world real-person issues, things that people take heated positions on — it’s not topics like what food I ate or what games I’m playing in fourth grade any more — and my identity is pretty public here, so who knows what’ll happen. Oh well. I’m probably just paranoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also delayed, as the articles I’m talking about are old; the latest two news items are the shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile and then the police shooting at the Dallas rally. That was also really sad, but I don’t think I have anything insightful to say about it. Let me point you to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/black-lives-matter&#34;&gt;MIT Admissions post, “Black Lives Matter”&lt;/a&gt;, and then for something a bit more optimistic out of a huge range of possible choices, &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@Mandela/my-white-boss-talked-about-race-in-america-and-this-is-what-happened-fe10f1a00726#.wtnr99lp1&#34;&gt;this Medium article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although after I started writing this post, the story about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.indiatimes.com/news/world/muslim-man-hugs-isis-militant-armed-wearing-suicide-vest-before-explosion-saves-hundreds-of-lives-258126.html&#34;&gt;a Muslim man preventing an ISIS suicide bomber&lt;/a&gt; came out, so now this is mildly relevant again. Anyway, I guess the delay is no different from how I put up life posts weeks after the life event happens. So today, I bring you two old news articles about Islam that my friends shared and discussed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Green: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/todd-green-phd/is-islam-responsible-for-_b_10449060.html&#34;&gt;Is Islam Responsible For The Orlando Nightclub Shooting?&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
King: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/king-isis-terrorists-aren-muslims-evil-men-article-1.2699463&#34;&gt;ISIS terrorists aren’t Muslims — they’re just evil men hell-bent on carnage and destruction&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The second one first, whose argument is, to be frank, weak. I think this piece from &lt;cite&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/cite&gt; by Wood, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/&#34;&gt;“What ISIS Really Wants”&lt;/a&gt;, is a better-researched overview of ISIS while still being pretty readable. One caveat is that it’s somewhat old. But its central claim is quite the opposite: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[The] Islamic State is Islamic. &lt;em&gt;Very&lt;/em&gt; Islamic. … [T]he religion preached by its most ardent followers derives from coherent and even learned interpretations of Islam.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a long, long piece, so to get a feel for the evidence, here are some key quotes:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most unexpectedly different facets of life during my internship has been the meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not talking about the food; it’s certainly different in a fantastic way (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/DropboxTuckShop/?fref=ts&#34;&gt;Dropbox’s food (link to Facebook page)&lt;/a&gt; is like something out of a high-end restaurant), but I knew that before coming already. Also of note is the way I started eating ∞% more ramen over the weekends than I did over the entire school year at MIT, because here I can’t buy that many groceries without them spoiling and am amazingly lazy in this new environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, this (deadlined, so not that well-thought-out, but whatever) post is about conversations at meals, which happen basically every lunch and some dinners when my team eats together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never had any regular experience like it. Of course I’ve had many meals at home with family, but they feel different because, well, it’s family and we have so many topics in common. I went to the same school for twelve years and we didn’t generally use a cafeteria; we just ate at our desks in our classrooms, or while doing things like attending club meetings or taking makeup tests. Sometimes if people felt like it they would push desks together to eat, but eating by oneself was totally normal. (At last, I feel like that was what it was. It seems so far away now that I don’t trust my memory, which is pretty sad… I faintly suspect I would have this experience in a more stereotypical American high school. But this is mostly just based off the cafeteria in &lt;cite&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/cite&gt;, a movie I only watched in its entirety on the flight here, which is weird because I know I’ve seen the “The limit does not exist!” part much much earlier. /aside)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at MIT? “Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(I’m making random short posts to entertain certain people during spring break.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since air-dropping into this crazy cultural salad bowl of a place, I’ve met a lot of people whose names get mispronounced. All sorts of long vowels and short vowels and consonants and word boundaries that jump across languages unpredictably. As a result, people often acquire nicknames or alternative names to get called by, whether actively, passively, or somewhere in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, my name is easy and boring. Now, I rather doubt I’d want an exciting name, in the sense of a name that everybody mangles in excitingly different ways. I’m not exactly dissatisfied with people calling me “Brian”. It just strikes me that I think I’ve gone my entire life without a meaningful nickname or even meaningful derivative of my name.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Zootopia</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/zootopia</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/zootopia</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(So. It’s spring break. Two-week-late post, and somehow by the end it’s all aboard the angst train again?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Sundays ago, I mobbed with a small group of MIT furries to watch &lt;cite&gt;Zootopia&lt;/cite&gt;, the recent highly-reputed Disney movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Before anything else, first there were the previews. I was impressed that every single one of them — there were six or so — was about an upcoming movie featuring anthropomorphic animals front and center. Let me see if I can remember all of them… in no particular order, &lt;cite&gt;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;The Secret Life of Pets&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;The Jungle Book&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Storks&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Finding Dory&lt;/cite&gt;, and &lt;cite&gt;Ice Age: Collision Course&lt;/cite&gt;. &lt;ins datetime=&#34;2016-04-09T05:10:42+00:00&#34;&gt;edit: Oh, also &lt;cite&gt;Angry Birds&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/ins&gt; Wow, I said, they know their audience.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went into the movie with a vague impression that &lt;cite&gt;Zootopia&lt;/cite&gt; was more adult-oriented than most Disney films — not in the naughty way, but in general making a lot of jokes and invoking a lot of parallels that I think only adults might have the experience to get. My suspicions were confirmed a few lines into the movie, where there was a joke about taxes I cracked up at but can’t imagine that children a few years younger would have found funny. If you the reader haven’t watched it, I hope that was vague enough not to ruin the start for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To be fair — and, uh, some parts of the internet are kind of big on this fact — the film also at one point enters a nudist colony. Fortunately (?), &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsLackAttributes&#34;&gt;Animals Lack Attributes&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More Fiction (Part 2.5)</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/more-fiction-part-2-5</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2015 20:27:44 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/more-fiction-part-2-5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is not Part 3. It’s just two things I thought of tacking on to &lt;a href=&#34;https://betaveros.wordpress.com/2015/07/04/more-fiction-2/&#34;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can I say? Part 2s are easy blog post fodder; Part 2 appendixes are even easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One, there’s one other wall I run into often during those rare attempts when I get motivated enough to try to write a story: naming characters is hard. At least, it provides an excellent motivational roadblock whenever I even consider committing a story to paper, a point before I’ve actually written anything at which I think “maybe I should give up and go on Facebook instead” and proceed to do so. Aggh. And I think there’s more than one reason for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I have trouble coming up with names to some degree. Sure, it’s easy to browse BabyNames.com and look for choices, but a lot of the names there are really weird and contemplating them for every unimportant character kind of rips me out of the immersed mindset.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Reading great stories in English class and elsewhere may have gotten me feeling like every name ought to be a deep meaningful allusion, or at least pun fodder. I feel like I will regret it if I write a story and, a few months and/or chapters down the road, realize I missed a better name or the name I chose has some undesirable connotations in context or provides an atmosphere-ruining coincidence.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think the real kicker is simply that some part of me is terrified of the awkwardness of giving a character the same name as anybody I know, because then they might read the story and wonder if the character is somehow based on them. And too many of the names that I consider common enough to not lure readers off into looking for hidden meanings are used up that way. This is obviously worst if the character is an antagonist. But it seems just as awkward if the character is a protagonist in accord with everything I’ve written, i.e. a paper-thin character blatantly created for escapist purposes. I am already kind of terrified I might ever meet anybody with the same name as one of my mentally established characters even though I haven’t actually written anything about him. And there’s a well-established convention of &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit&#34;&gt;not reusing a first name in a work&lt;/a&gt;, so this gets even harder with every work; I’m just as worried, what if somebody thinks this character is related to the other character in that story I wrote in second grade? Oh no!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like not reusing variable names in a programming language where everything is in the same scope. Positively nightmarish.&lt;/p&gt;
And I actually discovered some evidence this is a thing in my past: I found some stories I wrote in 2004. They are possibly the most extreme exemplification of &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhatYouKnow&#34;&gt;Write What You Know&lt;/a&gt; imaginable: the main character, Michael, goes to school and makes friends. That’s all.

&lt;p&gt;I kind of want to share these stories, but fast-forward a few years and you’ll see that a classmate named Michael entered my grade and we stayed in the same grade until we graduated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bilingualism II</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/bilingualism-ii</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2015 23:16:46 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/bilingualism-ii</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;我本來還想把這一篇用英文跟中文各打一次來實際比較看看，但這已經被困在草稿匣夠久了。一直做重複、吹毛求疵、沒有效率的修改本來就是我寫心情文時的弊病，如果再要求修改時要保持兩種語言版本的同步的話，大概寫到天荒地老都寫不完。（如果讀者沒有讀過我最近亂發的文章，故事都是這樣的：我覺得我在草稿匣累積了太多寫一半的文章，所以在畢業後，我&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;在六月十一號決定從那天開始每天發文，直到我出國&lt;/a&gt;，目的是強迫自己把那些草稿寫完，中間還亂發很多其他我本來大概不會寫下來的東西。其實還滿有成就感的。另外，如果你的中文沒有很爛的話，如果你在任何地方認為我寫的中文不流暢或是可以寫得更好，請毫不留情的留言批評。這也是一件我發現我在寫中文方面很缺乏的經驗，我會很感謝。當然，根據以往經驗，懇求讀者留言沒什麼機會成功。）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you came to this blog or this post hoping to read English, sorry not sorry. It’s only fair, really, given how many people on Facebook can’t read the massive English textwall posts I’ve spammed them with for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;常常有人訝異我的英文這麼好。有時候這些人還會問我怎麼學的－－碰到這種問題我都不知道要怎麼回答。喔，很簡單啊，只要選擇在一個主要說英文的國家出生，然後跟一群從國外回來的同學一起讀有80%的課是用英文上的學校連續讀十二年就好了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;偶爾也有人知道我是雙語部的或在不同的情況下認識我，反而會覺得我的中文比他們預期的好，例如我的駕訓班教練。其實我在雙語部還是上了十二年的國文課，進度理論上跟其他學校一樣（「理論上」三個字要強調），我也跟身旁很多親戚朋友用中文溝通了更久。比奧林匹亞競賽的經驗應該也讓我認識的上普通國語教學學校的學生，比其他雙語部同學認識的多。所以這應該也不奇怪吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是。其實我對這兩個語言的精熟度其實還是差很多。日常對話沒問題，不過我對英文細枝末節的部分瞭解的比中文多太多太多了。家裡有不止一本「常見英語錯誤」類的書，我小時候會當小說讀－－我是一個很奇怪的人。在學校課程中，我編輯自己或他人的英文文章是一天到晚的事情，什麼奇怪的句子跟構造都碰過、想過、修理過。還有些時候，我會很自然的寫出一個英文單字，然後發現我不知道為什麼自己會知道這個單字的意思，但就是有一種感覺告訴我，對，subsist的意思就是「存活於只有最基本的需求被滿足的情況」。跟中文比較：有時候，直覺也會告訴我有某一個成語是可以用的，但我只能清楚想到這個成語的兩、三個字。聽起來很「對」，不過我就是想不到第四個字是什麼，或是怕前三個字換成錯別字，再加上懷疑整個成語意思根本不是我模糊腦袋裡現在浮現的，因為我認得這些字字面上的意思，但無法說服自己為什麼它們合在一起可以解釋成這種意思，最後只好放棄，用國小白話文的措詞就好了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
「總覺得，我在用任何偏離國小程度的白話文的詞彙的時候都是假裝的。」
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我在舊一點的草稿寫出了這個句子，不過那一串「的」字讓我覺得怪怪的，現在想想，沒有人跟我討論過寫出這種或其他奇怪的句子時應該怎麼辦。哪一些「的」可以省略？有辦法把句子重寫（recast）避開嗎？還是不管它，我覺得它聽起來很奇怪純粹是錯覺，多讀一點中文就會發現根本沒什麼大不了的？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;使用兩種語言的方法也差很多。看看這個部落格就知道了。我相信我在學校雙語部外的大部分台灣朋友不會試著去理解我關於自己長篇大論的英文作文，但長篇大論的文章還是我最認真表達自己的地方。反觀我的中文短文，都通常是那種搞笑、釣讚、裝弱的文。（不，我真的很弱。）我不時會發現自己在網上逛到一個陌生人的心情文，看得津津有味。我們之間的關係頂多是朋友的朋友的朋友，我只知道我跟他應該都喜歡數學這個共同點罷了，但因為語言，我在那些瞬間覺得自己瞭解他勝於瞭解幾乎所有在我身邊講中文的朋友。我自己怎麼看這件事都覺得不合理，有點慚愧。&lt;/p&gt;
我回去讀了&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/bilingualism&#34;&gt;我第一次寫的關於雙語的文章&lt;/a&gt;，可能有一點過火：後來證實，在我的朋友中似乎真的有會純粹為了抒發感情而寫七言律詩的人。而且，我講中文的朋友圈裡，文學類佔的比例本來就應該比他們在整個社會裡佔的比例少很多。在學校跟在生活裡，吸收英文多於中文（而且數學多於英文）是我做的選擇，只是我自己不知道選擇的中介點好不好罷了。是否，我花在跟講中文的親戚朋友互動的力氣不夠？ 
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;想寫這一堆字的靈感有一部分來自一次返校活動（九月，可以算出這篇文章停滯在草稿期的時間的下界）。我跟同學在玩一些返校活動的遊戲，我在同學之間嘴裡不停的蹦出笑話，開玩笑的挑逗人。有可能有一點過火，沒有很嚴重不過我的確覺得說了一些我希望我沒說的話。之後，我又跟同學坐在教室暢談了一段時間，聊各種高三、準畢業生的事情。可能有一個小時吧，細節不重要，重點是這引發我想到我說中文的時候好像只會有想說的話沒有說，而好像幾乎沒有過類似的交談。我跟家人、親戚、其他學校的同學沒有辦法以同樣自然的方式交談。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/more-fiction-1&#34;&gt;Part 1 was here&lt;/a&gt;. This is still part of the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak I have openly committed to&lt;/a&gt; and standard disclaimers still apply. Just as in &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/fiction&#34;&gt;my original post&lt;/a&gt;, back to the flip side — let’s see what I have to do to &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; fiction to my own satisfaction. And this time I have a guide: the list I made in the first part of this post. Could I create fiction I would enjoy reading?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1: I enjoy calling things before they happen…&lt;/p&gt;
2: …I also enjoy the Reveal for questions when the author has done something clever I didn’t catch…

      <title>More Fiction (Part 1)</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/more-fiction-1</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2015 13:41:12 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/more-fiction-1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m going to do it again! I’m going to break a post into parts to milk it for the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak&lt;/a&gt;. Desperate times call for desperate measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mostly a self-analysis post though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING: &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TVTropesWillRuinYourVocabulary&#34;&gt;This post contains many, many TVTropes links.&lt;/a&gt; If you are like me and need to be productive but are &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife&#34;&gt;liable to being sucked into TVTropes&lt;/a&gt;, maybe you should find a way to commit to not clicking on any of these links, or just stop reading. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/609/&#34;&gt;obligatory xkcd&lt;/a&gt; is kind of long and also featured on one of the TVTropes links I’ve already made, so I’m not going to embed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/fiction&#34;&gt;blogged about this before in 2013&lt;/a&gt; — how I felt that the analysis trained into me by English class was dulling my ability to appreciate and write the types of fiction I really enjoyed. After thinking about it I realized the mismatch goes deeper than that. Because the things I seek the most in fiction are escapism and entertainment. I like simple fiction with obvious (though maybe not &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious&#34;&gt;that obvious&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop&#34;&gt;Aesops&lt;/a&gt; and extreme economy of characters via making all the reveals being of the form “X and Y are the same person” (which does not quite seem to be a trope but may be an occurrence of &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConnectedAllAlong&#34;&gt;Connected All Along&lt;/a&gt;, with the most famous subtrope being &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather&#34;&gt;Luke, I Am Your Father&lt;/a&gt; (which is &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty&#34;&gt;a misquote&lt;/a&gt;!), and is also one common &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockEpilepticTrees&#34;&gt;Stock Epileptic Tree&lt;/a&gt;, so maybe this isn’t the best example), because not only are such reveals fun, they make the plot simpler. What can I say, it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The qualities of being thought-provoking or heartwarming are only bonuses for me; needless &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JigsawPuzzlePlot&#34;&gt;complexity in the number of characters or plots&lt;/a&gt; is a strict negative. Sorry, I don’t want to spend effort trying to remember which person is which and how a hundred different storylines relate to each other if they don’t build to a convincing, cohesive, and &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal&#34;&gt;Reveal&lt;/a&gt;, and often not even then. And I like closure, so I feel pretty miserable when writers &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot&#34;&gt;resolve a long-awaited plot point just to add a bunch more&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this I am ambivalent about long book series; most of my favorite works of fiction have come in long series but starting a new one always gives me &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommitmentAnxiety&#34;&gt;Commitment Anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. Even when there’s closure, when I finish an immersive movie or book I’m always left kind of disoriented, like I’ve just been lifted out of a deep pool and have to readjust to breathing and seeing the world from the perspective of a normal person on land. I like when I’m reading good fiction, but I don’t like going through withdrawal symptoms. If I want to read complicated open-ended events, I’ll go read a history textbook, because at least the trivia might come up useful some day; if I want tough problems I’ll just look at real life and think about the possibility of college debt and having to find a job and everything. (If it wasn’t obvious yet, this is why I hyperbolically hate on &lt;cite&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/cite&gt; often.) Even worse than all of this is multiple paragraphs full of scenery and nothing else, unless of course parts or maybe all of the scenery are &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun&#34;&gt;Chekhov’s Guns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some part of me is embarrassed to admit this because I’ve been educated for so long about deep literature that makes social commentary or reveals an inner evil of humanity or whatever. But then again, I don’t really need an education to appreciate the simple, fun fiction I apparently do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: there are a lot of famous classics or mainstream works I can’t really enjoy too much, or in some cases, at all. And yet, sometimes a random story or webcomic will appear and I just won’t be able to stop reading. Why? I decided to try making a list of things I like in fiction: &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quixotic Reimagining of Standardized Tests (Part 2)</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/quixotic-2</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2015 23:59:53 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/quixotic-2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you remember, &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/quixotic-1&#34;&gt;Part 1 was here&lt;/a&gt; and my goal is to construct a theoretical system of standardized tests that I would be satisfied by. Here’s what I’ve got. As usual, because of the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak I have openly committed to&lt;/a&gt;, standard disclaimers apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d have a first-tier test like the SAT, except this will be &lt;em&gt;explicitly designed&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to distinguish among the high performers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the test is to assess &lt;em&gt;basic&lt;/em&gt; proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics. Nothing else. Most good students, those who have a shot at “good colleges” and know it, will be able to ace this test with minimal effort and can spend their time studying for other things or engaging in other pursuits. Students who don’t will still have to study and it will probably be boring, but the hope is that, especially if you’re motivated to get into a good college, there won’t be much of that studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For colleges, the intention of this test is to allow them to require this test score from everybody without having to &lt;a href=&#34;http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-difficulty-with-data&#34;&gt;put up disclaimers&lt;/a&gt; that go like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is really not a difference in our process between someone who scores, say, a 740 on the SAT math, and someone who scores an 800 on the SAT math. So why, as the commentor asks, is there such a difference in the admit rate? &lt;em&gt;Aha! Clearly we DO prefer higher SAT scores!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Well no, we don’t. What we prefer are things which &lt;em&gt;may coincide&lt;/em&gt; with higher SAT scores…

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Life update: I got my driver’s license from the place where I learned to drive. Then I drove home from there with my mom, and it was zarking &lt;em&gt;terrifying&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, WordPress says it has protected my blog from 3&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; spam comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the morning tomorrow, I have a small surgical operation, so I can’t sleep too late. (Well, it ended up being pretty late anyway. Darn.) Therefore I think I’m going to do something unprecedented on this blog for the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/commitment&#34;&gt;daily posting streak&lt;/a&gt;: I’m going to post an incomplete non-expository post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the only purpose of the title is to get initials that are four consecutive letters of the alphabet..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more argumentative post sequences on my blog involved ranting against standardized tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My very first stab was probably the &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/test&#34;&gt;silly satire&lt;/a&gt; directed at the test everybody has to take that takes up two hours per day of an entire week. Once college became a thing in my life, I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/2400&#34;&gt;humblebrag rant&lt;/a&gt; after I took the SAT and then a &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/post/sat&#34;&gt;summary post&lt;/a&gt; after I snagged this subject for an English class research paper and finished said paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be plenty clear that I am not ranting against this part of the system because it’s disadvantageous to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it should also be said that I’ve read some convincing arguments for using standardized tests &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; in college admissions (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119321/harvard-ivy-league-should-judge-students-standardized-tests&#34;&gt;Pinker&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2003&#34;&gt;Aaronson&lt;/a&gt;). Despite the imperfections of tests, they argue, the alternatives are likely to be less fair and more easily gamed. The fear that selecting only high test-scorers will yield a class of one-dimensional boring thinkers is unfounded. And the idea that standardized tests “reduce a human being to a number” may be uncomfortable for some, but it makes no sense to prioritize avoiding a vague feeling of discomfort over trusting reliable social science studies. Neither article, you will note, advocates selecting &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of one’s college admits based on highest score. Just a certain unspecified proportion, one that’s probably a lot larger than it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although I wish the first article linked its studies, I mostly agree with their arguments. So this puts me in a tricky position. These positions I’ve expressed seem hard to reconcile! So, after arguing about all this with a friend who told me things like&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Re-Re-Revisiting the SAT</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/sat</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2014 00:54:03 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/sat</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, I got worked up about the test. Then I got a score and ranted about it on this blog. (I’m still uncertainly hoping that didn’t come off as arrogant. Let me add, I did not get a perfect PSAT.) Then a friend pitched to me the idea that I write an article about it for my school newspaper, which I did. It was far too long. As if that weren’t enough, I then decided to examine whether the SAT was an accurate prediction of “academic ability and success” for my English research paper. Now I’ve come full circle to this blog, where I’m going to try to synthesize and conclude everything, free of the shackles of the research paper format, to allow me to move on with my life. This post contains bits lifted from all three essays and lots of new stuff; I’ve been editing it for so long that I feel like I have it memorized. Its word count is around that of the newspaper article &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; the research paper, i.e. far far far too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whatever, nobody reads this blog anyway and I have to get this out of my system. When I said I wanted to “move on with my life”, I really meant my winter homework. Oops!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; I am not an admissions officer. I have not yet even been accepted to a prestigious university (despite rumors to the contrary…), for whatever definition of “prestigious”, unlike some of the bloggers I’m referencing. So some of this is pure speculation. On the other hand, some of it is researched and referenced, and I think the pure speculation still makes sense. That’s why I’m posting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, here we go…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the question of accurate prediction. The SAT is a useful predictor, but not as useful as one might assume. Intuitively, it ought to be more accurate than other metrics because it’s a &lt;em&gt;standardized&lt;/em&gt; test, whereas GPAs other awards vary by habits of teacher and region and are hard to compare objectively. But as a &lt;a href=&#34;http://research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012/7/researchreport-2008-5-validity-sat-predicting-first-year-college-grade-point-average.pdf&#34;&gt;study from the College Board &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the correlation of HSGPA [high-school GPA] and FYGPA [first-year GPA in college] is 0.36 (Adj. r = 0.54), which is slightly higher than the multiple correlation of the SAT (critical reading, math, and writing combined) with FYGPA (r = 0.35, Adj. r = 0.53).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

Note from the future, 2017: I am fairly unhappy with this rant as it stands — it makes many points I still agree with, but it just sounds sooo pretentious — but it is one of very few posts to actually receive a link from an external post I’m aware of, so I guess I should let it stand for historical interest. I wrote this years ago; please don’t take it out of context.
&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, I got unhealthily worked up about getting this score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of college, I only ever wanted a score that wouldn’t be a deal-breaker — anything above 2300 would be enough. Any other time I had left would be better spent in other endeavors. Such endeavors might help on the college app, but more importantly, I’d also get to enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;
So why am I here? Partly it’s because my classmates got worked up about it. Somebody specifically requested me to post my score somewhere. And partly it’s because there couldn’t be a better way at the moment to establish my authority to (yet again) rant against standardized tests here.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a sentiment randomly appears in my brain. I wonder about it. There’s a draft I’ve worked on because I’m trying to get something out of my bubble. My emotions are confusing and they need to be released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after a few sentences, they’ve been released, but the post’s not out there because I want to polish it. First it’s just a look-over for typoes or grammar, then maybe I want to get the flow of the sentences right or cut down the embarrassing bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on the third read-over, I don’t know why I’m writing it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
