      <title>[CIMC 2015 Part 3] Monsters and Pandas and Tigers, Oh My!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My inner perfectionist is crying that I have to post this, in particular over my pathetic &lt;a href=&#34;http://snowclones.org/2007/05/22/x-y-and-z-oh-my/&#34;&gt;snowclone&lt;/a&gt; title, but my inner pragmatist knows that, judging by my old blogging patterns, it’s now or never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18.06: 56%, haven’t touched it in a while, but I think I can do lots more on the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a non-contestant, I confess I feel totally uninvested in the results and find the Closing Ceremony boring. All contestants go up, country by country, and have their awards read off. No effort is made to make any sort of buildup to a climax. But maybe this is for the best; we don’t want anybody feeling shafted or discouraged from continuing to do math due to a mere elementary-/middle-school competition. Meanwhile, though, I’m browsing reddit on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this ceremony, the entire Taiwan delegation spends some time walking around outside while the guides make confused phone calls trying to decide where we eat lunch. My parents offer me some potato chips they bought somewhere, which are (as the label is really eager to point out) baked, not fried. Some time passes this way; eventually, the guides figure it out and we go through amazingly long queues to eat at the cafeteria, as usual. Then we are sent to a massive shopping mall for the afternoon, a place so large that its exits have number labels that go up into the double digits so that people don’t get lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take trippy failed panorama photos from the bus windows. &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/trippy-panorama.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/trippy-panorama.jpg?w=652&#34; alt=&#34;[trippy panorama of a shopping mall]&#34; width=&#34;652&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3321&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  The exit our group is supposed to use and remember is number 9. However, since just about everybody else from the competition is clustered around that exit, we choose to enter through a neighboring one, which is somewhat surprisingly numbered 5.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[CIMC 2015 Part 2] Journey of the Blue-White Slippers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Nontopical life update: Current 18.06 homework status: 34% (mildly screwed, probably won’t finish before I leave my cozy home for the U.S. and I usually struggle to get into the mood for homework while traveling, but I guess I’ll have to)) &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/18-06-1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/18-06-1.png?w=296&#34; alt=&#34;[18.06 status panel: 34%]&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (I’ve been spending most of my uptime doing said homework and running errands, and my downtime catching up on &lt;cite&gt;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&lt;/cite&gt; while farming the Flight Rising Coliseum. And, okay, making the above status panel. &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5295912/status.html&#34;&gt;Live version here&lt;/a&gt; courtesy of Dropbox’s Public folder. No regrets.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-3-excursions&#34;&gt;
Day 3 (Excursions)
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morning routine snipped. We come to the middle school again to eat breakfast and gather; the contestants will be taking their tests here (accompanied by one bottle of “Buff” energy drink each) while the rest of us will be going on an excursion. Before this happens, though, two Taiwanese contestants ask me and Hsin-Po some math problems. There’s a geometry problem, which I fail to solve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(paraphrased) In triangle △ABC, ∠A is 40° and ∠B is 60°. The angle bisector of ∠A meets BC at D; E is on AB such that ∠ADE is 30°. Find ∠DEC.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hsin-Po figures out that, once you guess (ROT13) gur bgure boivbhf privna vf nyfb na natyr ovfrpgbe naq gurl vagrefrpg ng gur vapragre, lbh pna cebir vg ol pbafgehpgvat gur vapragre naq fubjvat sebz gur tvira natyr gung gurl vaqrrq pbvapvqr.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Then, there’s a combinatorics problem in a book with a solution that they’re not sure about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(paraphrased) 15 rays starting at the same point are drawn. What is the maximum number of pairs of rays that form obtuse angles?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens really close to the test starts and although I have this feeling it’s isomorphic to a notable combinatorial problem, I don’t manage to articulate the isomorphism until it’s too late and they have to go. Indeed, this is more or less equivalent to (ROT13) Ghena: gur tencu unf ab sbhe-pyvdhr naq n pbzcyrgr guerr-cnegvgr tencu vf pbafgehpgvoyr. After thinking though the solution on their book, though, I realize I’ve never seen this proof of said theorem before! (But later I realize it’s actually the just very first proof that &lt;cite&gt;Proofs from the BOOK&lt;/cite&gt; offers. I probably skipped it because it involved induction as well as some algebraic manipulations that looked much less intuitive and natural than they really were, so it didn’t look as cool as the later proofs. Oooooops.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect I wouldn’t do too well if I had to participate in that contest right then. But anyway, excursion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long bus ride, we arrive at our first destination, Jingyuetan (淨月潭 lit. Clear Moon Lake&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), allegedly the sister lake to Taiwan’s own famous&lt;sup&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Moon_Lake&#34;&gt;Sun Moon Lake&lt;/a&gt;. We tour the place on a wall-less car and look at the lake and lots of trees. During a stop, I take some pictures of sunflowers and bees, as well as a stand selling Taiwanese sausages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/lake-1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/lake-1.jpg?w=652&#34; alt=&#34;[Lake and ferry]&#34; width=&#34;652&#34; height=&#34;369&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3294&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/lake-2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/lake-2.jpg?w=652&#34; width=&#34;652&#34; height=&#34;369&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3295&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/bee.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/bee.jpg?w=170&#34; alt=&#34;[Bee and sunflower]&#34; width=&#34;170&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3296&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/sausages.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/sausages.jpg?w=652&#34; alt=&#34;[Sausages advertised as from Taiwan!]&#34; width=&#34;652&#34; height=&#34;369&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3297&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car blares weird music during the tour, such as a version of Für Elise with all the accents on different beats and a disjointed remix of the viral Chinese song &lt;a href=&#34;https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E5%B0%8F%E8%8B%B9%E6%9E%9C_%28%E6%AD%8C%E6%9B%B2%29&#34;&gt;小蘋果&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Apple_%28song%29&#34;&gt;Little Apple&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with two other Chinese songs, connected with mumbling English rap segues. We also eat boxed lunches here while sitting on tiny, cramped foam mattresses on the dirt floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next stop is a museum, where there are lots of ancient historical artifacts I’m not very interested in. I find a collection of certificates involving or quoting Chairman Mao more intriguing:  &lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/mao.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/mao.jpg?w=652&#34; alt=&#34;[Certificates with quotes and/or pictures of Chairman Mao]&#34; width=&#34;652&#34; height=&#34;369&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3298&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[CIMC 2015 Part 1] Rainy Days in July (and Other Months)</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/cimc-2015-part-1</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 13:48:45 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/cimc-2015-part-1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We get up at 3:40 AM. By 4 AM we have left our house, speeding like a bullet into the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Ohai. Somehow it slipped my mind that I was ending my streak by leaving the country for a competition that would likely be highly bloggable, like my last two international olympiads, both of which led to notable post sequences on this blog. (Admittedly, the first one was never really completed…) My only excuse was that I was worried I might not be able to access my blog from inside the Great Firewall, but I did (via vpn.mit.edu) and even if I hadn’t, I could still have drafted posts locally in Markdown as I usually do, so I don’t know what I was thinking.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Also: because, as I’ve said way too many times recently, I need to do linear algebra homework, these posts aren’t going to be as complete or as perfect as I’d like them to be. Although I’m probably just saying this to persuade myself; I tend to include many of the boring parts as well as the interesting parts of the trip, which maybe benefits my future self at the expense of other readers. I probably need to get out of this habit more if I want to blog for a wider audience, though. Oh well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;backstory&#34;&gt;
Backstory
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imc-official.org/&#34;&gt;International Mathematics Competition&lt;/a&gt; (IMC) is, &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin&#34;&gt;as it says&lt;/a&gt;, an international mathematics competition. But I should add that it is for elementary and middle-school students (in other words, I am not competing, okay??). (edit: Also, one or two letters are often prefixed to indicate the host country, for whatever reason. This year it would be CIMC, C for China.) I am tagging along because I am a student of Dr. Sun, one of the chief organizers, and have been slotted to give a talk and possibly help with grading the papers and translating. My father is coming to help arrange a side event, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://dominosolver.com/&#34;&gt;domino puzzle game&lt;/a&gt; competition, which he programmed the system for; and my mom and sister are also coming to help with translation and other duties. Other people in our group: Dr. Sun himself, his longtime assistant slash fellow teacher Mr. Li (wow I’m sorry I forgot you while first writing this), my friend and fellow math student Hsin-Po, who is an expert at making polyhedra from origami or binder clips (and at Deemo); Chin-Ling, my father’s student/employee who also programmed lots of the domino puzzle server and possesses a professional camera; and, of course, all the elementary- and middle-school contestants, as well as most of their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’ve ever given this amount of background exposition about any event I’ve attended to my not-so-imaginary audience before. It feels weird. Some part of me is worried about breaking these people’s privacy by posting this, which makes a little bit of sense but not enough for me to think that it’s actually a valid reason to avoid or procrastinate blogging. I think it’s a rationalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;
Day 1
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only interesting thing that happens at the airport is a short loud argument in the queues for luggage check-in, perhaps partly fueled by our high number of people and of heavy boxes (gifts for other countries and raw materials for Hsin-Po’s polyhedra). I don’t know whose fault it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case I fail to scale the firewall, I attempt to download Facebook on my phone for one last look before boarding, but it fails during installation twice and I give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plane is not fancy enough to offer personal screens and entertainment centers for everybody, but thankfully the ride lasts only three hours, so this is tolerable. Instead, the plane plays the second &lt;cite&gt;Divergence&lt;/cite&gt; movie on overhead screens, which I watch half-heartedly. The plot setup seems interesting but the ending seems to me to involve two Ass Pulls™, although since I haven’t been paying much attention I am not confident if I just missed some foreshadowing or character development. On the flight, I also read the proof of the irrationality of powers of &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;cite&gt;Proofs from THE BOOK&lt;/cite&gt; and leaf through the magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t hear any good music on-board, except maybe “Space Oddity”, which is a little freaky to be listening to while cruising at so may kilometers in the sky. Perhaps because of this, I find myself singing and humming “Space Oddity” unexpectedly often over the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;arrival&#34;&gt;
Arrival
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first sign we see after alighting the plane consists entirely of characters that are the same in Simplified and Traditional Chinese — if I remember correctly, 「前有坡道，小心慢走」&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnoteRef&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Changchun airport looks like any other airport, coolly blue-themed with moving platforms. The restrooms have fancy bright purple soap. Even though I consciously think about how I have suddenly arrived in a country that places notable restrictions on freedom of speech and Internet access, I don’t feel it. Eep, what an anticlimax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/gravel.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//blog.vero.site/img/gravel.jpg?w=652&#34; alt=&#34;[People dragging luggage boxes over gravelly ground outdoors.]&#34; width=&#34;652&#34; height=&#34;369&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3267&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[IOI 2014 Part 3] Games of Luck and Strategy and Really Weird Noises</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/games</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shamelessly getting unfinished business out of the way. Yup, that’s me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excursion Day 1. We traveled down to Yilan on a bus. I played guess-it with Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
I was quite surprised at myself for remembering this game, but I think it’s simple and little-known enough to be worth mentioning. Guess-it is a remarkably pure game of luck and bluffing from one of Martin Gardner’s columns, played with a small odd number of cards, e.g. the 13 cards of one poker suit. The cards are dealt evenly to players (who can look at them) with one card left over, which is kept face down; players take turns choosing one of two actions:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Name a card and ask the other player if he or she has it. These questions must be answered honestly.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Guess the left-over card. The guesser wins if correct; the other player wins if not.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess-it is not trivial because sometimes you should ask the other player if he or she has a card that you already see in your hand; otherwise whenever you answered “no” to a query you’d immediately guess that the asked card is the hidden one. It is actually a solved game in the sense that the probabilities of the Nash equilibrium strategy for when to guess and when to bluff have been worked out already, but they’re not simple probabilities by any means and humans are terrible randomizers anyway. A few rounds of it sure beats rock-paper-scissors. I was very amused to lose almost all our games with 11 cards but win almost all of our games with 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, no more gratuitous narrative excursions into game-theory. The first stop, National Center for Traditional Arts, was a very laid-back culture place with old-fashioned retro shops and streets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[IOI 2014 Part -1] Prelude.hs</title>
      <link>//blog.vero.site/post/prelude</link>

      <guid>//blog.vero.site/post/prelude</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Indexing debates are boring. Especially when you can just flagrantly disregard all concerns about memory safety (because C++ never had any in the first place) and write &lt;code&gt;int _array[100008], array = _array + 2;&lt;/code&gt; I do this alarmingly often; hence, the title. Hashtag firstworldanarchists. Three ± 1 cheers for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.6-latest/html/libraries/array-0.4.0.1/Data-Array.html#v:array&#34;&gt;Haskell arrays&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. One of the disadvantages of entering an international competition as the home team is a lack of time to completely absorb the idea that what is about to happen is a Big Thing. There was lots of time before the other international competitions I went to to spend uncomfortably on airplanes trying to adjust for the timezone difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so for a competition in one’s own country. Right up to the night before entering the hotel that marks the beginning of everything, I’m still at home, furiously refreshing the AoPS IMO fora and Facebook for news (!!!), lazily solving trivial Codeforces Div II problems with &lt;del&gt;pointless&lt;/del&gt; point-free Haskell one-liners, and blogging. (There’s more, but I kind of want it to be a surprise.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let’s set the rules. Well, there’s only one, honestly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes. I know it’s been more than a month. Blogging motivation decreases, but the responsibility of that &lt;em&gt;stay tuned&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s okay. It’s all worth it because the stuff in the games room is absolutely ridiculous. Warning: huge post.&lt;/p&gt;

[edit: okay guys I’m surprised at many people come here with search queries looking for solutions. If you want IMO solutions, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewforum.php?f=834&#34;&gt;the corresponding AoPS forum&lt;/a&gt; invariably has many of them. This is probably late-ish, but just in case.]
&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 of the contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that in Chinese [or Mandarin, whatever] “four” is unlucky because it’s a homophone for “death”, and hospitals tend to skip it in floors or ward numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that there was going to be an anecdote involving the seventh Artemis Fowl book but I couldn’t make it work so instead you have a weird and utterly disconnected metareference to something deleted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know, it sounded cool at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 4.&lt;/strong&gt; Find all functions f: Z → Z such that, for all integers a,b,c that satisfy a+b+c = 0, the following equality holds: &lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[f(a)^2+f(b)^2+f(c)^2=2f(a)f(b)+2f(b)f(c)+2f(c)f(a).\]&lt;/span&gt; (Here Z denotes the set of integers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An innocent-looking functional equation, but once you start trying it you discover that there’s quite some depth to it. Random guessing can yield that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(f(x) = x^2\)&lt;/span&gt; is a solution, so I proved inductively that after dividing out a constant f(1) then the remaining part of f is a perfect square. Letting &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(f(x) = f(1)g(x)^2\)&lt;/span&gt; with g(x) a nonnegative integer and factorizing the original equation, I got an auxiliary functional equation equivalent to the original equation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I could spend all day coming up with post titles like this one. Really, I could. Anyway, after receiving the letter gently reminding me to turn in the official IMO report in Chinese, I finished that first and turned it in. This, plus the fact that I don’t have any way to do any of my summer homework yet, should make continued blogging much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These months of preparation and anticipation, and in just over two days it will be behind us forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus were my thoughts at 3:30 in the morning, which were a much worse method of preparation than that which I used for the APMO, which involved trying for the first time to put my compass in its box and staring at a cryptic crossword. Twisted thoughts as I lay innocently in bed, trying to preserve my spirit and mathematical function. I got up at 6:30 and ate a breakfast nervously with the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dispersed into the contest hall. Flat squarish white tables in orderly rows greeted us. They were considerably smaller than the arm-span tables we had last year in the Netherlands’ stadium, but the space was still ample compared to the ones we took our practice tests on at home. I floundered a bit looking for whoever was supposed to check our stuff for forbidden items, but none of the proctors paid any attention to that, so I flipped through my own jacket pockets paranoidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But preparation was too brief, and there were at least fifteen minutes left with nothing to do except try not to panic. I managed to fill these fifteen minutes by doing elaborate breathing exercises, raising and flapping my arms, counting down seconds, focusing on a color word, meditating badly, clearing out everything nonmathematical from my mind with a symbolic gesture. This is not a very coherent description, but I wasn’t feeling very coherent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened an eye halfway and watched as the clock ticked down the last few seconds. The starting signal sounded. I opened up the problem envelope…  (nonessential expressions deLaTeXed; you’re welcome)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[IMO 2012 Part 3] Luggage Carriers and Language Barriers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who knew coming up with strangely cryptic and illogical but nice-sounding post titles was so much fun!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this break in storytelling is mainly brought to you by generic summer laziness, as well as possibly a tiny bit of chemotherapy adverse effect. There is only a little perfectionism involved, and that’s because this post contains a long awkward situation (you might have guessed already). I guess this is what it feels like to have oodles of stuff to blog about, but not enough motivation. Heck, these few days with running the TAIMC have long filled my list of rant topics with juicy stories until it’s near-bursting. But I need to end this self-pity party before I get carried away, so… back to the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stranded in a foreign country at least 20 degrees Celsius below our comfort zone, having worn the same clothes for 36 hours of airplane travel, and still with less than 48 hours until the contest and &lt;em&gt;zero out of six compasses&lt;/em&gt;, we were running out of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick inventory of clothes showed that, after including the vests and caps in the backpacks we got, we probably had just enough clothes to survive the cruel frigid environment. So, reluctantly, we left the games room and hit the street to hunt down some underwear and socks to change into. Not to mention toothbrushes and some T-shirts and jackets for good measure, because the inside of the hotel was not the right temperature for full cold-resistance gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some haphazard wandering up and down the streets later, we found a store that suited our needs and picked up some clothes. The underwear came in two sizes: too loose and too tight. We picked the latter. Oh well, it would only be for a day or so… right?  And so that was our first day without our luggage. We survived. My iPod finally ran out of battery the second day while furiously refreshing my email, trying to stay connected and update everybody. The schedule marched ahead without us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
