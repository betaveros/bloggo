	<p>One thing many mathematically-inclined programmers run into when implementing mathematical algorithms, particularly number-theoretic ones, is that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation">modulo operation</a> doesn’t behave how they expect or prefer.</p>
<p>In many languages, this operator is denoted <code>%</code>. Concretely, one might prefer that, if the second argument is positive, then the modulo operation would always give a nonnegative result. Under this behavior, the expression <code>(-5) % 3</code> would evaluate to <code>1</code> rather than <code>-2</code>. This is a lot more useful for number theory because then for positive integers <code>n</code>, the <code>% n</code> operation actually maps integers to exactly the <code>n</code> canonical representatives for the residue classes. As a result, <span class="math inline">\(a \equiv b \mod n\)</span> if and only if <code>a % n == b % n</code>. You can also do things like index into a length-<code>n</code> array with <code>a % n</code> and know that the index will be in-bounds. Finally, there are also optimization opportunities: modding by a power of 2 becomes equivalent to a simple bitwise AND, which is really fast on modern computers.</p>
<p>A few programming languages, notably Python, do implement <code>%</code> this way. However, the majority of languages today, including pretty much everything remotely descended from C, do not; instead, <code>(-5) % 3</code> is <code>-2</code>. This post attempts to track down why.</p>
<hr />
<p>The first thing to note is that there is a more important number-theoretic identity we’d like to have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\texttt{a} = (\texttt{a / b}) \cdot \texttt{b} + (\texttt{a \% b}). \tag{1}\]</span></p>
<p>In words, the integer division and modulo operators should give a breakdown of <code>a</code> into a sum of some copies of <code>b</code> plus a remainder. Note that this equation also implies that specifying the rounding behavior of division is equivalent to specifying the sign behavior of the modulo operation, which will come up repeatedly later.</p>
<p>It’s also very uncontroversial that that remainder should have no copies of <code>b</code>, positive or negative, left over, which gives the constraint:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[|\texttt{a \% b}| &lt; |\texttt{b}|. \tag{2}\]</span></p>
<p>Every programming language I can think of satisfies these two constraints.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> So far so good. However, these two constraints don’t uniquely determine the values of <code>a % b</code> when <code>a</code> isn’t divisible by <code>b</code>; there are two possible values for <code>a % b</code>, one positive and one negative. Concretely, we could express <span class="math inline">\(-5\)</span> as either <span class="math inline">\((-1) \cdot 3 + (-2)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\((-2) \cdot 3 + 1\)</span>, so <code>(-5) % 3</code> could be <code>-2</code> or <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>It’s still mostly uncontroversial that, if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are both positive, then <code>a % b</code> should be nonnegative as well; we could call this constraint (3).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, if <code>a</code> is negative and <code>b</code> is positive, programming languages start to diverge in their behavior. Why?</p>

	<p>It’s December, so it’s time for a lot of things, including <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>. I will not be able to be as competitive as I was last year, and already lost a lot of points to a really silly mistake on day 1, but I’ll be playing when I can and <a href="https://github.com/betaveros/advent-of-code-golf-2019">golfing</a> the problems when I have time (so far: 7 + 14 bytes).</p>
<p>As one might expect, <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1">Day 1</a> is not too complex, but the second part can be analyzed to some mathematical depth and was discussed a bit on Reddit; plus, it occurred to me recently that I set up KaTeX on my blog but never used it, so I was looking for an excuse to write some equations anyway.</p>
<p>The problem statement for part 2, in brief: We are tasked with calculating the total mass of fuel required to launch a rocket module of a given mass. For something of mass <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, one can compute the directly required mass of fuel by dividing <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> by 3, rounding down, and subtracting 2; if the result is negative, it is taken to be 0 instead. However, the directly required fuel also requires fuel itself, calculated from its own mass by the same procedure, and that required fuel requires fuel based on its own mass, and so on until you reach fuel with 0 requirement.</p>

<p>The “Extreme Value Theorem”, according to my old calculus textbook (Larson, Hostetler, Edwards, 8th ed.), is “A continuous function defined on a closed interval attains a minimum and a maximum on the interval.” The calculus textbook continues,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although [it] is intuitively plausible, a proof of this theorem is not within the scope of this text.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course Rudin proves this, but coming from an unrigorous calculus background, the required deductions span three chapters and are very hard to motivate. That’s probably because it proves things for extremely general objects.</p>
<p>In particular, I have no idea why the definition of “compact” is what it is: “a set for which every open cover has a finite subcovering”. Therefore, here’s a less general but more motivated proof, from the grounds-up.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Real numbers</strong> are hard to define. We only need to know that we can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and compare them, i.e. they’re an ordered field, and that they have the <strong>least-upper-bound property</strong>. That is, if we have a set of real numbers that are bounded above, then the set has a <em>least upper bound</em>, a bound that “perfectly fits” the set. Precisely, the bound must be such that every element of the set is less than or equal to it, and no smaller value satisfies the same property.</p>

	Continuing the porting of stuff from betaveros.stash, and adding more stuff.
Mnemonic Here’s my mnemonic table for digits, inspired by an old Martin Gardner column. I wrote from memory the first 132 digits of 2012! correctly at IMO 2012 with this table. I had remembered more, but unfortunately, if I recall correctly, I confused myself over whether I had encoded a 5 or a 2 by the S of “nose”, because this is supposed to be more of a phonetic code than a spelling one — otherwise double letters would be confusing and lots of randomly appearing digraphs would be wasted, because English is weird.

<p>Functional programming is terribly addicting! Partly I think the completely different way of thinking makes it feel like learning programming, and falling in love with it, all over again. Partly there’s this evil sense of satisfaction from using <code>$</code>s (and later <code>&lt;$&gt;</code>s and <code>=&lt;&lt;</code>s and <code>&amp;&amp;&amp;</code>s) to improve readability for initiated Haskellers and worsen it for everybody else. Partly it’s because <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/"><i>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</i></a> is such a fun read — there are too many funny bits to list but my favorite so far is when the author analyzes the first verse of Avril Lavigne’s <em>Girlfriend</em>.</p>
<p>Although I think my code in Haskell tends to be more readable than in other languages, code obfuscation in Haskell is almost natural: all you have to do is refactor the wrong function to be “pointfree”, which means that even though it’s a function that takes arguments, you define it without parameters by manipulating and joining a bunch of other functions. Example (plus a few other tiny obfuscations):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" data-line-number="1">isPrime <span class="fu">=</span> liftA2 (<span class="fu">&amp;&amp;</span>) (liftA2 (<span class="fu">$</span>) (all <span class="fu">.</span> ((<span class="fu">.</span>) (<span class="dv">0</span> <span class="fu">/=</span>)) <span class="fu">.</span> rem) (flip</a>

<p>QQ wordpress why no Haskell highlighting <ins>(Editor’s note from 2017: The migration should highlight this now!)</ins></p>
<p>Also, for some reason, you can do this in Haskell:</p>

<p>Okay, but seriously now. I wrote this about my journey to learn functional programming in the <a href="//blog.vero.site/post/programming">programming babble post</a> half a year ago:</p>

	This is beautiful. Why do they have to make it sound all mysterious and difficult? That’s (the reciprocal of) the golden ratio, by the way.

Transcript since the resolution is far from awesome: “Most angiosperms have alternate phyllotaxy, with leaves arranged in an ascending spiral around the stem, each successive leaf emerging 137.5° from the site of the previous one. Why 137.5°? Mathematical analyses suggest that this angle minimizes shading of the lower leaves by those above.
